 <h2>About hostage situations</h2>
 <p>A hostage negotiation happens when a criminal or deranged person uses innocent people as bargaining chips. This can happen in a range of circumstances</p>

 <h2>Hostage situation circumstances</h2>
 <p>There may be one or more hostages of any age. The situation may be planned or ad hoc. There may be one or more hostage-takers, who are usually armed.</p>

 <h2>hostage taker choices</h2>
 <p>Hostage takers may kill hostages or release them. Kill themselves by their own hand or in a shoot-out. Negotiate a way out (often desired, seldom possible). Give themselves up.</p>

 <h2>First arrival</h2>
 <p>Police will on a hostage scene before a negotiator and may be trained to use the ICER concept</p>

 <h2>ICER concept</h2>
 <p>The IER convept stands for Isolate, Contain, Evaluate, Report </p>

 <h2>What is Isolate</h2>
 <p>Isolate the hostage zone, creating an outer perimeter and keeping keep onlookers beyond the police safety line.</p>

 <h2>What is Contain</h2>
 <p>Limit the mobility of the hostage taker to the smallest area possible (the inner perimeter) and prevent them from observing police activity.</p>

 <h2>What is Evaluate</h2>
 <p>Evaluate the original information provided, which may be from the hostage taker or a representative, or perhaps a member of the public. Without causing any escalation, gather as much additional information as possible, including the number of hostage takers and hostages, their appearance, weapons and so on. Assess the threat and estimate the resources that may be needed to handle the situation.</p>

 <h2>What is Report</h2>
 <p>Report all available information gathered, including on the hostage takers and hostages,  events, weapons, zones, routes and so on, informing other officers and the chain of command.</p>

 <h2>Preventing early harm</h2>
 <p>The first job of the hostage negotiator is to assure safety. When they arrive on the scene, there may be armed police, high emotion and general confusion in which hostages may get hurt. Their immediate task is to get a swift briefing from the officer in charge and to ensure that any actions by the police do not lead to hostages being harmed. </p>

 <h2>Getting communitcation organized</h2>
 <p>organize communications with the hostage-takers. Hostage-takers usually want this, to make their demands known. If the negotiation looks like it could take some time (which may be days or more), then a permanent position must be found. There may also be covert monitoring, for example with window lasers and hidden cameras. Everything that provides information is used, including relatives, friends and other sources.</p>

 <h2>Getting close</h2>
 <p>A critical process used in many hostage negotiations is to get close to them, to build bonds and gain their trust. Creating normality. Creating humanity. Developing authority</p>

 <h2>Creating normality</h2>
 <p>Whilst there may be chaos and panic on all sides, the negotiator first seeks to create calm. They talk in a calm voice and do a great deal of listening. In particular, they seek to establish a sense of normality amongst the emotion, a space in which the hostage-takers can talk with the negotiator as reasonable people, much as you would talk with any normal person on the phone. The negotiator is always there and always ready to talk. They will listen to everything and will create an even keel on which reasonable negotiation can be conducted.</p>

 <h2>Creating humanity</h2>
 <p>Within the normality, the negotiator listens uncritically to the hostage-taker, accepting them as they are and creating a sense of humanity. From that humanity, they then can extend to discussing the hostages, how they are bearing up and whether they are unwell.</p>

 <h2>Developing authority</h2>
 <p>The negotiator may also seek to position themself as an authority figure. This can start by being authoritative on behalf of the hostage-taker, for example in getting them communications and food. This may later turn to being authoritative with the hostage-taker, which can be a tricky and dangerous activity as the hostage-taker wants to be in charge. Authoritative work may thus be done in particular circumstances. If the negotiators can establish this relationship, they may be able to direct the hostage-taker's actions more effectively.</p>

 <h2>Developing the scene</h2>
 <p>Once a relationship is established, the negotiator can seek to move the situation forward. Small steps. Managing stress. Exploring solutions</p>

 <h2>Small steps</h2>
 <p>Progress may be in small steps, as trust and relationships continue to be built. Food and medicine may be given. Conversation with a hostage may be requested. Everyday chat creates normality. Depending on the urgency of the situation, the negotiator may seek to speed up or slow down the talking. If hostages are hurt, then speed may be needed. If the hostage-takers are requiring transport or other things that would lead to more problems, then it may be more prudent to insert delays, such as saying you are 'looking into it'.</p>

 <h2>Managing stress</h2>
 <p>Stress and tension will continue throughout the negotiation in some way. The negotiator may deliberately manage this, reducing stress to create hostage safety, but also possibly increasing stress to wear down the hostage-taker.</p>

 <h2>Exploring solutions</h2>
 <p>Talks will eventually get around to what can be done to resolve the situation. The negotiator may ask the hostage-taker for their thoughts and may offer possibilities themselves. Of course the safe release of the hostages is always an important element. The goal of the hostage taker may be simply to escape and may be for publicity or other gain. If this is not acceptable to the authorities, for example release of a captured terrorist leader, then other alternatives must be found.</p>

 <h2>Releasing the hostages</h2>
 <p>Options are: Wearing them down. Releasing the weak. Concessions for people. The final assault</p>

 <h2>Wearing them down</h2>
 <p>Sometimes, just talk, talk, talk is enough to wear down the hostage-takers and for them to give themselves up. High emotions do not last for ever and are followed by exhaustion. The ideal negotiation ends with the hostage-taker agreeing to let everyone go. </p>

 <h2> Releasing the weak</h2>
 <p>Depending on the number of people taken hostage, a release of children, old people and those with medical conditions may be negotiated. It allows the hostage-takers to show that they are not 'bad' people after all and also rids them of the problems of illness and wailing children.</p>

 <h2>Concessions for people</h2>
 <p>People may also be exchanged for various concessions, from food to publicity. When something is given to the hostage-takers, especially if it is on their list of demands, then a concession may be requested in return, with the ultimate concession of hostage release.</p>

 <h2>The final assault</h2>
 <p>It is a very delicate balance for the negotiator when no clear exchange can be found and the hostage-takers look like they are going to kill hostages. Whilst they are seeking to create exchange, the negotiator must also find the point at which they pull the plugs and let the armed forces take over. Even though some hostages may be killed, force may ultimately be the best solution to minimize total harm.</p>

 <h2>Trust</h2>
 <p>Trust is the key to the door of other people's minds. If they don't trust you, then you haven't a hope in Hades of persuading them. If they do trust you, it doesn't necessarily mean you can persuade them, but at least they will now listen to you and take you seriously.</p>

 <h2>Creating trust</h2>
 <p>Options are: Active Care. Appeal to Trust. Be Reliable. Building Rapport. Evidence. Expressing Care. Passive Care. Self-Control. Similarity. Teasing. The Trustee's Choice.</p>

 <h2> Active Care</h2>
 <p>Show that you care about other people. Not just by being nice and friendly (although this does count), but by going out of your way to help them.</p>

 <h2>Appeal to Trust</h2>
 <p>To use this, show you are trustworthy in some ways (such as being helpful or friendly) and then extend it to an assumption that because you can be trusted for some things you can therefore be trusted for all things. You can also show credibility through things like your profession. 'Trust me, I'm a doctor' is a classic line that assumes doctors always tell the truth.</p>

 <h2>Be Reliable</h2>
 <p>Be reliable. Do what you say you are going to do. Turn up on time. Always repay debts. If you make a promise then always do your very best to keep it. If you cannot, apologize work to make amends so they know it was not through lack of care.</p>

 <h2>Building Rapport</h2>
 <p>'Rapport' is 'a feeling of sympathetic understanding', where two people feel a bond between one another, such that they will more easily trust one another.</p>

 <h2>Evidence principle</h2>
 <p>In our interactions with others, we often disagree and know that they will try to persuade us. If you tell me something, I can easily deny it, effectively saying that you are either mistaken or a liar. Evidence, however, comes from outside the other person, which means we cannot attribute it to their person, and must judge it independently. Evidence is particularly powerful for disconfirmation and destroying beliefs. If I find out about my partner cheating on me, all faith and trust are instantly destroyed. Such a change can cause a significant emotional response.</p>

 <h2>Expressing Care</h2>
 <p>When expressing care, do so in a kind voice. Give them time to tell you any of their troubles. If they ask after you in return, only tell them your problems if you know this will help the relationship. When you do so, keep it brief and emotionally restrained.</p>

 <h2>Passive Care</h2>
 <p>When working with and around other people, make sure that you do not harm them in any way through your words or actions. Do not be blindly selfish. When you act, consider how your actions will affect others. Do not harm them emotionally by speaking harshly or unkindly to them, or otherwise acting in ways that will upset them.</p>

 <h2>Self-Control and Trust</h2>
 <p>If you want somebody to trust you, then it helps if you can show that you have a clear ability to control yourself. This not only includes a general self-control but also the ability to control short-term impulses. In doing so, it can be more effective if this process is visible, such that you are seen to be experiencing inner conflicts and emotions and yet clearly displaying self-control, with a calmer outer behavior. Keep this subtle, with muted body language, perhaps with less movement, pauses, slight facial expressions and so on.</p>

 <h2>Similarity principle</h2>
 <p>When we are trying to decide whether to trust someone, we often do not have time to find out how trustworthy they actually are, so we take a short-cut by assuming that someone who is either similar to us or who is similar to someone we would trust. We seek similarity in beliefs, values, attitudes, ways of thinking, understanding and deciding. We also look for short-cuts in physical appearance, words and actions.</p>

 <h2>Teasing</h2>
 <p>Teasing is the curious action of deliberately confusing or annoying other people. In two words, it has been described as 'playful vexation', which suggests the intention of fun and a lack of seriousness.</p>

 <h2>Trustee's Choice</h2>
 <p>When a person is asked to do something, they are the 'trustee' (as opposed to the 'truster' who must trust them). They have a choice whether to be trustworthy or not.</p>

 <h2>Stress</h2>
 <p>Stress is a part of the human condition, a gift from nature to help keep us motivated. Sometimes, however, we get too much of it. In yourself and in changing minds, managing stress is a key activity.</p>
