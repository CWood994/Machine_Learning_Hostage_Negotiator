		 <h3 align="center">How Hostage Negotiation
			 Works</h3>
		 <p>A hostage situation is a law-enforcement worst-case scenario,
		 because it places innocent civilians directly in harm’s way. Armed
		 intervention becomes very risky, since the hostages themselves can
		 be harmed either by stray bullets or by the hostage-takers. That
		 makes the negotiation the most important aspect of any hostage
		 crisis. A skilled negotiator must find out what the hostage-taker
		 wants, who he or she is and what it will take to achieve a peaceful
		 outcome, all while ensuring the safety of the hostages and other
		 bystanders.</p>
		 <h3>The Hostage Situation</h3>
		 <p>Although hostage situations can vary greatly based on
		 the motivations of the hostage-taker and the exact circumstances
		 surrounding the incident, there are some basic facts that apply to
		 all hostage situations.</p>
		 <ul>
			 <li>The hostage-taker wants to obtain something. This can
				 be as simple as money, personal safety or safe passage to another
				 country, or it can involve complicated political
				 goals.</li>
			 <li>The target of the hostage-taker is not the hostage; it
				 is some third party (a person, a company or a government) that can
				 provide whatever it is the hostage-taker wants.</li>
			 <li>The hostages are bargaining chips. They may have
				 symbolic value (as at the 1972 Munich Olympics, in which the target
				 was the Israeli government and the hostages were Israeli athletes),
				 but the hostages themselves could be anyone.</li>
		 </ul>
		 <h3>Hostage situations move through several distinct
			 phases:</h3>
		 <ol>
			 <li>Initial Phase– This phase is
				 violent and brief and lasts as long as it takes for the
				 hostage-takers to make their assault and subdue the hostages. The
				 end of this phase is often marked by the presentation of the
				 hostage-takers’ demands.</li>
			 <li>Negotiation Phase– At this point,
				 law-enforcement officials are on the scene, and the demands have
				 probably been received. This phase can last hours, days or months
				 and could also be referred to as “the standoff phase.” Physically,
				 nothing about the situation changes greatly. The hostages and the
				 hostage-takers stay in the same place. However, a lot is happening
				 during this phase in terms of the relationships developing between
				 everyone involved. The negotiator’s job boils down to manipulating
				 those relationships in a way that results in a peaceful
				 ending.</li>
			 <li>Termination Phase– This is the brief,
				 sometimes violent final phase. This phase has one of three
				 results:</li>
		 </ol>
		 <ul>
			 <li>The hostage-takers surrender peacefully and are arrested.</li>
			 <li>Police assault the hostage-takers and kill or arrest them.</li>
			 <li>The hostage-takers’ demands are granted, and they escape.</li>
		 </ul>
		 <p>The fate of the hostages does not necessarily depend on what
		 happens during the termination phase. Even if the hostage-takers
		 give up, they may have killed hostages during the negotiations.
		 Often, hostages are killed either accidentally by police or
		 intentionally by their captors during an assault. There have even
		 been cases in which the hostage-takers were granted their demands,
		 but they killed a hostage anyway (Aston, pg. 23).</p>
		 <p>There is also a post-incident stage in which the effects of the
		 incident play themselves out. These effects can include changes in
		 the status of the groups responsible, shifts in the relationships
		 between world governments or increases in security.</p>
		 <p>Now that we’ve seen how most hostage situations are similar,
		 we’ll take a look at the ways in which some hostage incidents
		 differ from others.</p>
		 <h3>What should be done first?</h3>
		 <p>One of the first things a negotiator does when he or she
		 arrives on the scene of a hostage crisis is find out as much as
		 possible about the hostage-taker. The most basic question is: Why
		 did this person take a hostage? There are a few common
		 reasons.</p>
		 <ul>
			 <li>The hostage-taker might be emotionally or
				 mentally disturbed. His or her specific reason for taking
				 a hostage may be illogical. He or she may be suicidal. This is the
				 only type of hostage situation in which the hostage is often
				 related to the hostage-taker. This type of hostage situation is
				 unplanned.</li>
		 </ul>
		 <ul>
			 <li>Some criminals use innocent bystanders as human
				 shields to protect themselves from the police. In
				 most cases, this happens when a criminal is caught, panics and
				 grabs a hostage to help himself escape. In rare cases, hostages are
				 part of a plan used by professional criminals to aid in their
				 escape, but usually, it is unplanned.</li>
			 <li>The most famous hostage situations in history have been the
				 result of carefully planned attacks by terrorists and radical
				 political groups. The hostage-takers intend from the beginning
				 to trade the lives of the hostages for
				 whatever specific goals they want to achieve. These can range from
				 changes in one or more countries’ political policies, the release
				 of political prisoners or the repeal of specific laws. Terrorist
				 groups may also have goals that they will achieve regardless of the
				 outcome: destabilizing the target of their attack and attracting
				 attention to their cause.</li>
		 </ul>
		 <p>Kidnapping is a form of hostage crisis, but it doesn’t resemble
		 a typical hostage situation in which the hostage-takers are
		 barricaded in a known area. Kidnappers keep their hostage in a
		 secret location, and communication is often one-way — the
		 kidnappers tell the authorities what to do. As a result, there
		 isn’t much negotiating.</p>
		 <p>Regardless of the hostage-taker’s motivation, the basic element
		 of negotiating remains the same. “You work to build a rapport and
		 encourage them to bring about a peaceful conclusion. The same
		 techniques are used whenever someone is in crisis,” said Lt.
		 Schmidt.</p>
		 <h3>The primary objectives of a negotiator
			 are:</h3>
		 <p>Prolong the situation.<br>
		 The longer a hostage situation lasts, the more likely that it will
		 end peacefully. Tactics include stalling while an official with
		 more authority is consulted, getting deadlines pushed back,
		 focusing the hostage-takers’ attention on details such as what type
		 of airplane they  want and asking them open-ended questions rather 
		 than yes/no questions.</p>
		 <p>Ensure the safety of the hostages.<br>
		 This means convincing the hostage-taker to allow medical treatment
		 or release for sick or injured hostages, negotiating the delivery
		 of food and water and negotiating the release of as many hostages
		 as possible. Getting some of the hostages out of the situation not
		 only ensures their safety, but it also simplifies the situation in
		 the event that an armed assault becomes necessary. In addition,
		 released hostages can provide invaluable information about the
		 locations and habits of the captors and the other hostages.</p>
		 <p>Keep things calm.<br>
		 From the initial assault through the first hours of negotiations,
		 hostage-takers can be extremely volatile. They’re usually angry
		 about whatever perceived injustice has led them to take hostages,
		 and they are filled with adrenaline following the excitement of
		 their attack. Angry, excited people with machine
		 guns are not good for hostages. The negotiator should
		 never argue with a hostage-taker and never say no to a demand.
		 Instead, the negotiator should use delaying tactics or make a
		 counter-offer. Above all, the negotiator should keep a positive,
		 upbeat attitude, reassuring the hostage-taker that everything will
		 eventually work out peacefully.</p>
		 <p>Foster the growth of relationships between negotiator
		 and hostage-taker and between hostage-taker and
		 hostages.<br>
		 The negotiator must seem credible to the captor. That is, the
		 negotiator must act like he or she understands the reasons for the
		 hostage-taker’s actions but still come across as strong – not just
		 eager to please. The negotiator can also encourage activities that
		 require cooperation and interaction between the captors and the
		 hostages, such as sending food and medical supplies in bulk
		 packages that have to be prepared. When the hostage-taker gets to
		 know the hostages and sees them as human beings, it becomes more
		 difficult to execute them. In a 1975 hostage standoff on a train in
		 Holland, a hostage, Robert de Groot, who had been chosen for death,
		 was spared after the terrorists heard him pray for his wife and
		 children. Some of the hostage-takers wept, and two of them agreed
		 to avoid a lethal shot when they pushed him out of the train. He
		 rolled down an embankment unscathed, played dead and escaped a
		 short while later (Barker, pg. 33). When the terrorists selected
		 other hostages for execution, they didn’t allow prayer and killed
		 them quickly to avoid the emotional strain.</p>
		 <p>Next, we’ll find out how negotiators balance hostage safety with
		 political reality.</p>
		 <h3>Stockholm Syndrome</h3>
		 <p>Spending hours, days and months together doesn’t only foster
		 feelings on the part of the hostage-taker toward the hostages. The
		 hostages often develop sympathy for their captors, as well. This is
		 known as Stockholm Syndrome, named after a Swedish bank heist gone
		 wrong that resulted in a six-day stand-off. The hostages ended up
		 assisting the robber, acting as lookouts and giving him advice,
		 while gradually coming to view the police outside as their common
		 enemy. One of the female hostages even married him while he was
		 still in prison.</p>
		 <p>There are complicated psychological reasons for Stockholm
		 Syndrome. It is in part a defense mechanism that allows people to
		 cope with an otherwise unbearable situation. It also has something
		 to do with power – the hostage-taker has the power to kill the
		 hostages, and when he doesn’t, the hostages’ relief can turn into
		 gratitude, which eventually develops into sympathy. Also, fear of
		 the police rushing into the situation and killing the hostages
		 accidentally in a shootout is very powerful and helps turn the
		 hostages against the authorities.</p>
		 <h3>Making a Deal</h3>
		 <p>At the beginning of a hostage crisis, the
		 hostage-takers’ demands are often unreasonable. They might ask for
		 huge sums of money or for the release of thousands of fellow
		 terrorists from jails. Of course, the negotiator can’t just give
		 them anything they ask for, even if it would mean safety for the
		 hostages. The policies of any nations involved, the ability to
		 actually acquire the items being demanded and the need to consult
		 with the situation commander and high-ranking political officials
		 all limit what a negotiator can offer to the hostage-takers. Plus,
		 if anyone who took hostages immediately had all of his or her
		 demands granted, the world would face one hostage crisis after
		 another.</p>
		 <p>However, the negotiator can “chip away” at the situation
		 by offering minor concessions, such as food and water, promises of
		 transportation and media coverage. In return, the hostage-takers
		 can trade some of the hostages or some of their weapons or agree to
		 downgrade some of their demands. By continuing this process, the
		 negotiator can gradually weaken the hostage-takers’
		 position.</p>
		 <p>Most countries have official policies regarding
		 negotiating with terrorists. However, these policies shift with
		 time, and they tend to be flexible depending on the situation. If
		 the hostages are children or important political officials, even
		 the most hard-line non-negotiating government might make an
		 exception. In many cases, secret deals are made that allow the
		 government to accept demands and save the hostages but maintain
		 their public hard-line stance against giving in to terrorists’
		 demands.</p>
		 <p>Israel, the United States and Russia are all nations
		 that have a reputation for strict non-negotiation policies.
		 However, every policy is open to exceptions. One example is the
		 1985 hijacking of TWA Flight 847. The Hezbollah hijackers demanded
		 the release of more than 700 Shiites who were in Israeli prisons.
		 After a long ordeal, all the hostages were released (except one
		 American, who was murdered by the hijackers), and Israel released
		 all 766 prisoners.</p>
		 <h3>Not Making a Deal</h3>
		 <p>Although refusing to negotiate with terrorists is often
		 a politically popular idea (no one wants to “give in” to
		 terrorists), it can be disastrous. Even if the government has no
		 intention of granting the demands, the process of negotiating
		 itself is vital to achieving a peaceful resolution. Two of the most
		 horrific hostage incidents in history ended in tragedy in large
		 part due to Russia’s outright refusal to negotiate with Muslim
		 Chechen separatists.</p>
		 <h3 align="center">NEGOTIATION

		 <h2>Getting close</h2>
		 <p>A critical process used in many hostage negotiations is
		 to get close to them, to gain their trust.</p>
		 <h3>Creating normality</h3>
		 <p>Whilst there may be chaos and panic on all sides, the
		 negotiator first seeks to create calm. They talk in a calm voice
		 and do a great deal of listening. In particular, they seek to
		 establish a sense of normality amongst the emotion, a space in
		 which the hostage-takers can talk with the negotiator as reasonable
		 people, much as you would talk with any normal person on the
		 phone.</p>
		 <p>The negotiator is always there and always ready to talk.
		 They will listen to everything and will create an even keel on
		 which reasonable negotiation can be conducted.</p>
		 <h3>Creating humanity</h3>
		 <p>Within the normality, the negotiator listens
		 uncritically to the hostage-taker, accepting them as they are and
		 creating a sense of humanity. From that humanity, they then can
		 extend to discussing the hostages, how they are bearing up and
		 whether they are unwell.</p>
		 <h3>Developing authority</h3>
		 <p>The negotiator may also seek to position themselves as
		 an authority figure. This may start by being authoritative on
		 behalf of the hostage-taker, for example in getting them
		 communications and food. This may later turn to being
		 authoritative<em>with</em>the hostage-taker. This can
		 be a tricky and dangerous activity, as the hostage-taker wants to
		 be in charge. Authoritative work may thus be done in particular
		 circumstances. Nevertheless, if the negotiators can establish this
		 relationship, they may be able to direct the hostage-taker’s
		 actions more effectively.</p>
		 <h2>Developing the scene</h2>
		 <p>Once a relationship is established, the negotiator can
		 seek to move the situation forward.</p>
		 <h3>Small steps</h3>
		 <p>Progress may be in small steps, as trust and
		 relationships continue to be built. Food and medicine may be given.
		 Conversation with a hostage may be requested. Everyday chat creates
		 normality.</p>
		 <p>Depending on the urgency of the situation, the
		 negotiator may seek to speed up or slow down the talking. If
		 hostages are hurt, then speed may be needed. If the hostage-takers
		 are requiring transport or other things that would lead to more
		 problems, then it may be more prudent to insert delays, such as
		 saying you are ‘looking into it’.</p>
		 <h3>Managing stress</h3>
		 <p>Stress and tension will continue throughout the
		 negotiation in some way. The negotiator may deliberately manage
		 this, reducing stress to create hostage safety, but also possibly
		 increasing stress to wear down the hostage-taker.</p>
		 <h3>Exploring solutions</h3>
		 <p>Talks will eventually get around to what can be done to
		 resolve the situation. The negotiator may ask the hostage-taker for
		 their thoughts and may offer possibilities themselves. Of course
		 the safe release of the hostages is always an important
		 element.</p>
		 <p>The goal of the hostage taker may be simply to escape
		 and may be for publicity or other gain. If this is not acceptable
		 to the authorities, for example release of a captured terrorist
		 leader, then other alternatives must be found.</p>
		 <h2>Releasing the hostages</h2>
		 <h3>Wearing them down</h3>
		 <p>Sometimes, just talk, talk, talk is enough to wear down
		 the hostage-takers and for them to give themselves up. High
		 emotions do not last for ever and are followed by exhaustion. The
		 ideal negotiation thus ends with the hostage-taker agreeing to let
		 everyone go.</p>
		 <h3>Releasing the weak</h3>
		 <p>Depending on the number of people taken hostage, a
		 release of children, old people and those with medical conditions
		 may be negotiated. It allows the hostage-takers to show that they
		 are not ‘bad’ people after all and also rids them of the problems
		 of illness and wailing children.</p>
		 <h3>Concessions for people</h3>
		 <p>People may also be exchanged for various concessions,
		 from food to publicity. When something is given to the
		 hostage-takers, especially if it is on their list of demands, then
		 a concession may be requested in return, with the ultimate
		 concession of hostage release.</p>
		 <h3>The final assault</h3>
		 <p>It is a very delicate balance for the negotiator when no
		 clear exchange can be found and the hostage-takers look like they
		 are going to kill hostages. Whilst they are seeking to create
		 exchange, the negotiator must also find the point at which they
		 pull the plugs and let the armed forces take over. Even though some
		 hostages may be killed, force may ultimately be the best solution
		 to minimize total harm.</p>
		 <h3>APPRECIATING
		 TRUSTWORTHINESS</h3>
		 <p>Trust is the key to the door of other
		 people’s minds. If they don’t trust you, then you haven’t a hope in
		 Hades of persuading them. If they do trust you, it doesn’t
		 necessarily mean you can persuade them, but at least they will now
		 listen to you and take you seriously.</p>
		 <p>So manage trust carefully. It can, as they say, take a lifetime
		 to build and a moment to lose. And the simplest way to do this is
		 to be trustworthy. Be dependable. Care about people. Deception may
		 persuade people for now, but the cost of being found out can be
		 extremely high.</p>
		 <p>Stress is a part of the human condition, a gift from nature to
		 help keep us motivated. Sometimes, however, we get too much of it.
		 In yourself and in changing minds, managing stress is a key
		 activity.</p>
		 <p>First, manage your own stress. Listen to your body. Spot
		 the symptoms	
		 Then find ways of reducing it. Relax, exercise, eat well. When you
		 are feeling stressed, take a break. Under excessive stress, you are
		 not at your best — in fact you are near your worst. A bit of stress
		 is ok, but too much is very bad for you.</p>
		 <p>Stress is also a key tool in persuasion, and creating tension happens
		 in virtually all persuasive situations. The trick is to manage that
		 stress: too much and the person will crack. Too little and they
		 will not change.</p>
		 <h3>UNDERSTANDING STRESS</h3>
		 <p>STRESS is something that affects us
		 all. If we can learn to recognize it, then we can learn to manage
		 it. Management of stress often seeks to reduce it in ourselves,
		 friends and clients. It also can be a tool for motivation and
		 persuasion, as increasing tension also
		 increase the desire to reduce it. It thus be used, with care, to
		 effectively move both ourselves and others.</p>
		 <h3>Making stress positive</h3>
		 <p><a href=
		 "http://changingminds.org/explanations/behaviors/coping/sublimation.htm">
			 Sublimation</a>is the method we use when we displace negative
		 stresses into positive and useful actions. Thus we can take the
		 tension of being a student and use it to motivate ourselves to work
		 hard, or take the frustrations of work and sublimate these into a
		 useful and creative hobby.</p>
		 <p>Stress can also be converted to a positive force by gaining a
		 deeper understanding of the people who are causing stress for you.
		 When you realize that much of their behavior towards you is
		 actually<a href=
		 "http://changingminds.org/explanations/behaviors/coping/displacement.htm">displaced</a>frustrations
	 about themselves, you can convert your own<a href=
	 "http://changingminds.org/explanations/emotions/fear.htm">fear</a>and<a href="http://changingminds.org/explanations/emotions/anger.htm">anger</a>into
 genuine concern for them.</p>
		 <h2>Using stress to persuade</h2>
		 <p>Using stress to persuade is pretty much how persuasion works.
		 Virtually all persuasive activities involve manipulation of stress
		 levels, whether this is realized or not. For example,
		 the<a href=
		 "http://changingminds.org/principles/hurt_rescue.htm">Hurt and
		 Rescue principle</a>appears in many different forms of
	 persuasion.<a href=
	 "http://changingminds.org/explanations/behaviors/conditioning/conditioning.htm">Conditioning</a>involves<a href="http://changingminds.org/principles/association.htm">association</a>of
 stress and comfort with undesirable and desirable things.</p>
		 <p>The biggest trick in using stress is in the appropriate levels
		 being used. Too much and you will trigger the<a href=
		 "http://changingminds.org/explanations/brain/fight_flight.htm">Fight-or-Flight
		 reaction</a>. Too little and you will not get any motivated
	 response. To find the right level of stress requires a great deal
	 of attention and sensitivity. People who lack empathy often go
	 about motivating others with a sledge-hammer, and consequently
	 largely are unsuccessful.</p>

		 <h3>HURT AND RESCUE PRINCIPLE</h3>
		 <h2>Principle</h2>
		 <p>‘A drowning person will clutch at a straw’, so push them in the
		 water, then throw them a rope.</p>
		 <h2>How it works</h2>
		 <p>‘Hurt and Rescue’ is the underlying principle beneath many
		 different persuasion methods.</p>
		 <h3>Hurt</h3>
		 <p>Hurting the other person does not mean physical harm and it may
		 not even mean making them feel bad, but it does mean creating a
		 tension that they want to resolve.</p>
		 <h4>Negative and positive hurt</h4>
		 <p>Negative hurting means making them feel pain of some kind,
		 pointing out what is wrong, making them want to get away from
		 something.</p>
		 <p>Positive hurt, on the other hand, means making the other person
		 want something, creating desire, seeing what is good.</p>
		 <h4>Active and passive hurt</h4>
		 <p>Actively hurting someone means taking deliberate action, setting
		 them up, causing them pain by what you do.</p>
		 <p>Passive hurt may mean deliberately allowing a person to be hurt
		 when you could rescue them earlier (perhaps to have a greater
		 effect later).</p>
		 <h3>Rescue</h3>
		 <p>Rescuing a person means removing their hurt, saving themselves
		 from their pains. It creates<a href=
		 "http://changingminds.org/principles/closure.htm">closure</a>and
	 relief.</p>
		 <p>Rescuing can be a bit like fishing. It’s not just about reeling
		 in the fish. If they feel you pulling, then they may pull back and
		 you end up either with a tug of way or a broken line and a fish
		 disappearing into the distance.</p>
		 <h4>Grasping hopefully at straws</h4>
		 <p>Rescue may start with<a href=
		 "http://changingminds.org/explanations/emotions/hope.htm">hope</a>,
	 as people envisage and predict the relief of being rescued. Thus
	 they will grasp at straws in the desperate hope of rescue.</p>
		 <h4>Self-rescue</h4>
		 <p>In the ideal rescue, the solution is available and the person
		 rescues themself without your intervention. This can be arranged,
		 for example, by putting it in their path and helping them to ‘find’
		 it. You can then be suitably impressed and congratulate them.<br>
		 A key benefit of self-rescue is that they fully own the solution
		 hence are likely to adopt it more fully.</p>
		 <h4>Requested rescue</h4>
		 <p>It helps a great deal if, rather than having rescue thrust upon
		 the person, they ask for it first. This helps to ensure they
		 appreciate and own the solution.</p>
		 <h4>Offered rescue</h4>
		 <p>In practice, it is often necessary for you to offer rescue, such
		 as when they cannot see a solution even when it is in front of
		 them.<br>
		 When doing this, you may get some objections and resistance which
		 you must handle.</p>
		 <h4>Enforced rescue</h4>
		 <p>Finally, you may effect the rescue without their permission, for
		 example when they are in imminent danger.<br>
		 In such cases, they may not realize they are hurt and may strongly
		 resist your rescue attempts.</p>
		 <p>‘Hurt and Rescue’ seems pretty negative, by the way, but do not
		 be fooled by the wording. As with most methods, it can be used for
		 good or bad.</p>
		 <p>Hurt and rescue methods can range from the classic ‘Good cop–bad
		 cop’ routine to the most principled of therapeutic technique.</p>
		 <h3>THEORIES OF POWER</h3>
		 <p>Here are academic theories about how we gain and use power.</p>
		 <ul>
			 <li><a href=
			 "http://changingminds.org/explanations/theories/coercion.htm">Coercion</a>:
		 is acting to change a person’s behavior against their will.</li>
			 <li><a href=
			 "http://changingminds.org/explanations/theories/least_interest.htm">

				 has most power.</li>
			 <li><a href=

					 Strategic Contingencies Theory</a>: power depends on problem skill,
				 centrality and uniqueness of skill.</li>
		 </ul>
		 <p>Power is the ability to get what you want. As what you want is
		 often constrained by other people, the use of power often includes
		 changing or influencing what others think, believe and do. It is at
		 the heart of all techniques of changing minds.</p>

		 </ul>
		 <p>Understand the power you have as well as the power of other
		 people. Use your own power carefully. Perhaps the greatest power
		 you can have is to get others to use their power on your
		 behalf.</p>
		 <p>Beware of sleeping dragons: many people will only use their
		 power when aroused. The most effective power is that used so subtly
		 that people do not realize it is being used.</p>
		 <p>Power does not have to be used directly: threats are often
		 effective, especially when accompanied by displays of power. Like
		 gorillas thumping their chests, we seldom need to fight.</p>
		 <p>Power is often expressed in communication as a combination of
		 strength and humanity. This is very attractive and is a form
		 of<a href=
		 "http://changingminds.org/principles/hurt_rescue.htm">Hurt and
		 Rescue</a>.</p>
		 <h2>Greeting</h2>
		 <h3>Handshake</h3>
		 <p>As the other person approaches, move to left side, extend your
		 arm horizontally, palm down (be first to do this). Grab their palm
		 firmly, pull them in and hold their elbow with your left hand.</p>
		 <p>The horizontal arm is an unmissable signal. Palm on top is being
		 dominant, putting yourself on top. Holding the elbow further
		 controls them.</p>
		 <p>The<em>royal handshake</em>is outstretched arm to
		 keep the other at their distance. A limp hand, palm down, stops
		 them doing a power shake.</p>
		 <h3>Touching</h3>
		 <p>Touching is power symbol. Touching people can be threatening,
		 and is used by leaders to demonstrate power.</p>
		 <p>The handshake is, of course, a touch, and can lead to further
		 touching, such as the elbow grip and patting shoulders and
		 back.</p>
		 <p>Guide people with a palm in the small of the back. Greet them
		 with a hand on the back. Touch them on the elbow or other ‘safe’
		 areas.</p>
		 <h2>Speaking</h2>
		 <h3>Talking</h3>
		 <p>Talk with confidence and use the body beat in time with
		 assertions. Beat with a finger, a palm or even a fist (which is
		 rather aggressive). Emphasize and exaggerate your points.</p>
		 <p>Use silences too. Pause in the middle of speaking and look
		 around at everyone. If you are not interrupted they are probably
		 respecting your power. Stand confidently without speaking. Look
		 around, gazing into people’s eyes for slightly longer than
		 usual.</p>
		 <h3>Emoting</h3>
		 <p>It is powerful to show that you have emotion, but in the right
		 place only. It shows you are human. At other times it emphasizes
		 how you are in control. A neat trick is to bite the lower lip, as
		 it shows both emotion and control (Bill Clinton did it 15 times in
		 2 minutes during the Monica Lewinsky ‘confession’).</p>
		 <h2>And…</h2>
		 <h3>Walking</h3>
		 <p>Walk with exaggerated swinging of arms, palm down and out. Kink
		 elbows outwards, making the body seem wider. Add a slight
		 swagger.</p>
		 <p>When walking with others, be in front of them. When going
		 through doors, if you are going to an audience, go first. If you
		 are going from an audience, go last (guiding others through shows
		 dominance).</p>
		 <h3>Position</h3>
		 <p>Generally be higher. Sit on a higher chair. Stand over people.
		 Wear heels. Drive a higher car.</p>
		 <p></p>
		 <p>Dominant body language is related to<a href=
		 "http://changingminds.org/techniques/body/aggressive_body.htm">aggressive
		 body language</a>, though with a less emotional content.</p>
		 <h2>Size signals</h2>
		 <p>The body in dominant stances is generally<a href=
		 "http://changingminds.org/techniques/body/open_body.htm">open</a>,
	 and may also include additional aspects.</p>
		 <h3>Making the body big</h3>
		 <p>Hands on hips makes the elbows go wide and make the body seem
		 larger. So also does standing upright and erect, with the chin up
		 and the chest thrust out. Legs may be placed apart to increase
		 size.</p>
		 <h3>Making the body high</h3>
		 <p>Height is also important as it gives an attack advantage. This
		 can be achieved by standing up straight or somehow getting the
		 other person lower than you, for example by putting them on a lower
		 seat or by your standing on a step or plinth.</p>
		 <h3>Occupying territory</h3>
		 <p>By invading and occupying territory that others may own or use,
		 control and dominance is indicated. A dominant person may thus
		 stand with feet akimbo and hands on hips.</p>
		 <h2>Superiority signals</h2>
		 <h3>Breaking social rules</h3>
		 <p>Rulers do not need to follow rules:
		 they<em>make</em>the rules. This power to decide one’s
		 own path is often displayed in breaking of social rules, from
		 invasion and interruption to casual swearing in polite company.</p>
		 <h3>Ownership</h3>
		 <p>Owning something that others covet provides a status symbol.
		 This can be territorial, such as a larger office, or displays of
		 wealth or power, such as a Rolex watch or having many
		 subordinates.</p>
		 <p>Just owning things is an initial symbol, but in body language it
		 is the flaunting of these, often casually, that is the power
		 display. Thus a senior manager will casually take out their Mont
		 Blanc pen whilst telling their secretary to fetch the Havana
		 cigars.</p>
		 <h3>Invasion</h3>
		 <p>A dominant act is to disrespect the ownership of others,
		 invading their territory, for example getting to close to them by
		 moving into their<a href=
		 "http://changingminds.org/explanations/behaviors/body_language/proxemics.htm">body
		 space</a>. Other actions include sitting on their chairs, leaning
	 on their cars, putting feet up on their furniture and being
	 over-friendly with their romantic partners.</p>
		 <p>Invasion says ‘What’s yours is mine’ and ‘I can take anything of
		 yours that I want and you cannot stop me’.</p>
		 <h3>Belittling others</h3>
		 <p>Superiority signals are found both in saying ‘I am important’
		 and also ‘You are not important’. Thus a dominant person may ignore
		 or interrupt another person who is speaking or turn away from them.
		 They may also criticize the inferior person, including when the
		 other person can hear them.</p>
		 <h3>Facial signals</h3>
		 <p>Much dominance can be shown in the<a href=
		 "http://changingminds.org/techniques/body/parts_body_language/face_body_language.htm">face</a>,
	 from disapproving frowns and pursed lips to sneers and snarls
	 (sometimes disguised as smiles).</p>
		 <p>The eyes can be used to stare and hold the gaze for long period.
		 They may also squint, preventing the other person seeing where you
		 are looking. They may also look at anywhere but the other person,
		 effectively saying that ‘you are not even worth looking at’.</p>
		 <p>Faces can also look bored, amused or express other expressions
		 that belittle the other person.</p>
		 <p>Dominant people often smile much less than submissive
		 people.</p>
		 <h3>Phallic displays</h3>
		 <p>Dominant men will often expose their crotch, effectively saying
		 to other men ‘I am safe from attack’ or ‘my penis is bigger than
		 yours’, whilst showing off. They may also be offering ‘come and get
		 it!’ to women. When women do this, it is to some extent a tease or
		 invitation to men but may also be an emulation of the male display,
		 thus saying ‘I am as strong as a man’.</p>
		 <p>This appears in standing or sitting where the legs are apart. It
		 may be emphasized by scratching or adjusting of the crotch.</p>
		 <h2>The dominant greeting</h2>
		 <p>When people first meet and<a href=
		 "http://changingminds.org/techniques/body/greeting.htm">greet</a>,
	 their first interaction sets the pattern for the future
	 relationship. When a person is dominant here, then they will most
	 likely continue to be dominant.</p>
		 <h3>The handshake</h3>
		 <p>A classic dominant handshake is with the palm down, symbolically
		 being on top. Another form of dominant handshake is to use strength
		 to squeeze the other person.</p>
		 <p>Holding the other person’s hand for longer than normal also
		 shows that you are in control.</p>
		 <h3>Eyes</h3>
		 <p>Prolonged, unblinking<a href=
		 "http://changingminds.org/techniques/body/parts_body_language/eyes_body_language.htm">eye</a>contact
	 acts like overplaying the handshake — it says ‘I am powerful, I can
	 break the rules.’ The dominant person may alternatively prevent eye
	 contact, saying ‘You are beneath me and I do not want even to look
	 at you.’</p>
		 <h3>Speaking</h3>
		 <p>The person who speaks first often gets to control the
		 conversation, either by talking for longer or by managing the
		 questions.</p>
		 <h2>Responding to dominance</h2>
		 <p>If others display dominant body language you have a range of
		 options.</p>
		 <p>The simplest response is simply not to submit, which is what
		 they probably want. Continue to appear friendly and ignore their
		 subtle signals.</p>
		 <p>Another response is to fight dominance with dominance, for
		 example:</p>
		 <ul>
			 <li>Out-stare them (a trick here is to look at the bridge of their
				 nose, not their eyes).</li>
			 <li>Touch them, either before they touch you or immediately when
				 they touch you.</li>
			 <li>When they do a power handshake, grab their elbow and step to
				 the side.</li>
			 <li>When they butt in to your speech, speed up, talk more loudly
				 and say ‘let me finish!’</li>
		 </ul>
		 <p>Another approach is to name the game. Ask them why they are
		 using dominant body language. A good way to do this is in a
		 curious, unafraid way.</p>
		 <p>A significant cluster of body movements is used to signal
		 aggression.</p>
		 <p>This is actually quite useful as it is seldom a good idea to get
		 into a fight, even for powerful people. Fighting can hurt you, even
		 though you are pretty certain you will win. In addition, with
		 adults, fighting is often socially unacceptable and aggression
		 through words and body language is all that may ever happen.</p>
		 <h2>Threat</h2>
		 <h3>Facial signals</h3>
		 <p>Much aggression can be shown in the face, from disapproving
		 frowns and pursed lips to sneers and full snarls. The eyes can be
		 used to stare and hold the gaze for long period. They may also
		 squint, preventing the other person seeing where you are
		 looking.</p>
		 <h3>Attack signals</h3>
		 <p>When somebody is about to attack, they give visual signal such
		 as clenching of fists ready to strike and lowering and spreading of
		 the body for stability. They are also likely to give anger signs
		 such as redness of the face.</p>
		 <h3>Exposing oneself</h3>
		 <p>Exposing oneself to attack is also a form of aggression. It is
		 saying ‘Go on – I dare you. I will still win.’ It can include not
		 looking at the other person, crotch displays, relaxing the body,
		 turning away and so on.</p>
		 <h2>Invasion</h2>
		 <p>Invading the space of the other person in some way is an act of
		 aggression that is equivalent to one country invading another.</p>
		 <h3>False friendship</h3>
		 <p>Invasion is often done under the cloak of of familiarity, where
		 you act as if you are being friendly and move into a space reserved
		 for friends, but<em>without being invited</em>. This gives
		 the other person a dilemma of whether to repel a ‘friendly’ advance
		 or to accept dominance of the other.</p>
		 <h3>Approach</h3>
		 <p>When you go inside the<a href=
		 "http://changingminds.org/techniques/body/social_distance.htm">comfort
		 zone</a>of others without permission, you are effectively
	 invading their territory. The close you get, the greater your
	 ability to have ‘first strike’, from which an opponent may not
	 recover.</p>
		 <h3>Touching</h3>
		 <p>Touching the person is another form of invasion. Even touching
		 social touch zones such as arm and back can be aggressive.</p>
		 <h2>Gestures</h2>
		 <h3>Insulting gestures</h3>
		 <p>There are many, many<a href=
		 "http://changingminds.org/explanations/behaviors/body_language/gesture_type.htm">gestures</a>that
	 have the primary intent of insulting the other person and hence
	 inciting them to anger and a perhaps unwise battle. Single and
	 double fingers pointed up, arm thrusts, chin tilts and so on are
	 used, although many of these do vary across cultures (which can
	 make for hazardous accidental movements when you are overseas).</p>
		 <p>Many gestures are sexual in nature, indicating that the other
		 person should go away and fornicate, that you (or someone else) are
		 having sex with their partner, and so on.</p>
		 <h3>Mock attacks</h3>
		 <p>Gestures may include symbolic action that mimics actual attacks,
		 including waving fingers (the beating baton), shaking fists,
		 head-butts, leg-swinging and so on. This is saying ‘Here is what I
		 will do to you!’</p>
		 <p>Physical items may be used as substitutes, for example banging
		 of tables and doors or throwing . Again, this is saying ‘This could
		 be you!’</p>
		 <h3>Sudden movements</h3>
		 <p>All of these gestures may be done suddenly, signaling your level
		 of aggression and testing the other person’s reactions.</p>
		 <h3>Large gestures</h3>
		 <p>The size of gestures may also be used to signal levels of
		 aggression, from simple finger movements to whole arm sweeps,
		 sometimes even with exaggerated movements of the entire body.</p>
		 <p></p>
		 <p>Gestures, the movement of arms and hands, are different from
		 other body language in that they tend to have a far greater
		 association with speech and language. Whilst the rest of the body
		 indicates more general emotional state, gestures can have specific
		 linguistic content.</p>
		 <p>Gestures have three phases:<em>preparation,
			 stroke</em>and<em>retraction</em>. The real message is
		 in the stroke, whilst the preparation and retraction elements
		 consist of moving the arms to and from the rest position, to and
		 from the start and end of the stroke.</p>
		 <h2>Emblems</h2>
		 <p>Emblems are specific gestures with specific meaning that are
		 consciously used and consciously understood. They are used as
		 substitutes for words and are close to sign language than everyday
		 body language.</p>
		 <p>For example, holding up the hand with all fingers closed in
		 except the index and second finger, which are spread apart, can
		 mean ‘V for victory’ or ‘peace’ (if the palm is away from the body)
		 or a rather rude dismissal if the palm is towards the body.</p>
		 <h2>Iconic gestures</h2>
		 <p>Iconic gestures or<em></em><em>illustrators</em>are
		 closely related to speech, illustrating what is being said,
		 painting with the hands, for example when a person illustrates a
		 physical item by using the hands to show how big or small it is.
		 Iconic gestures are different from other gestures in that they are
		 used to show physical, concrete items.</p>
		 <p>Iconic gestures are useful as they add detail to the mental
		 image that the person is trying convey. They also show the first
		 person or second person<a href=
		 "http://changingminds.org/disciplines/communication/models/viewpoint.htm">viewpoint</a>that
	 the person is taking.</p>
		 <p>The timing of iconic gestures in synchronization with speech can
		 show you whether they are unconscious or are being deliberately
		 added for conscious effect. In an unconscious usage, the
		 preparation for the gesture will
		 start<em>before</em>the words are said, whilst in
		 conscious usage there is a small lag between words and gesture
		 (which can make the speaker appear manipulative).</p>
		 <h2>Metaphoric gestures</h2>
		 <p>When using metaphoric gestures, a concept is being explained.
		 Gestures are in three-dimensional space and are used to shape and
		 idea being explained, either with specific shapes such as finger
		 pinches and physical shaping, or more general waving of hands that
		 symbolizes the complexity of what is being explained.</p>
		 <h2>Regulators</h2>
		 <p>Regulators are used to control turn-taking in conversation, for
		 example in the way that as a person completes what they are saying,
		 they may drop their arms, whilst a person wanting to speak may
		 raise an arm as if to grasp the way forward.</p>
		 <h2>Affect displays</h2>
		 <p>Gestures can also be used to display emotion, from tightening of
		 a fist to the many forms of self-touching and holding the self.
		 Covering or rubbing eyes, ears or mouth can say ‘I do not want to
		 see/hear/say this’. Holding hands or the whole body can indicate
		 anxiety as the person literally holds themself. Self-preening can
		 show a desire to be liked and can indicate desire of another.</p>
		 <h2>Beat gestures</h2>
		 <p>Beat gestures are just that, rhythmic beating of a finger, hand
		 or arm. They can be as short as a single beat or as long as needed
		 to make a particular point.</p>
		 <p>Beating and repetition plays to primitive feelings of basic
		 patterning, and can vary in sense according to the context. A beat
		 is a staccato strike that creates<a href=
		 "http://changingminds.org/techniques/language/modifying_meaning/emphasis.htm">emphasis</a>and
	 grabs attention. A short and single beat can mark an important
	 point in a conversation, whilst repeated beats can hammer home a
	 critical concept.</p>
