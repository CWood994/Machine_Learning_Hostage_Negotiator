<p align="center"><strong>How Hostage Negotiation Works</strong><strong></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A hostage situation is a law-enforcement worst-case scenario, because
 it places innocent civilians directly in harm’s way. Armed intervention
 becomes very risky, since the hostages themselves can be harmed either 
by stray bullets or by the hostage-takers. That makes the negotiation 
the most important aspect of any hostage crisis. A skilled negotiator 
must find out what the hostage-taker wants, who he or she is and what it
 will take to achieve a peaceful outcome, all while ensuring the safety 
of the hostages and other bystanders.</p>
<p>Ideally, a hostage situation ends with everyone walking away (albeit 
with some of them in handcuffs). In this article, we’ll find out what 
happens on the scene of a hostage negotiation, how a negotiator gets the
 job done and what it takes to become a professional hostage negotiator.
 We will also take a look at the psychology of hostage-takers and 
hostages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Hostage Situation</strong></p>
<p>Although hostage situations can vary greatly based on the motivations
 of the hostage-taker and the exact circumstances surrounding the 
incident, there are some basic facts that apply to all hostage 
situations.</p>
<ul>
<li>The hostage-taker wants to obtain something. This can be as simple 
as money, personal safety or safe passage to another country, or it can 
involve complicated political goals.</li>
<li>The target of the hostage-taker is not the hostage; it is some third
 party (a person, a company or a government) that can provide whatever 
it is the hostage-taker wants.</li>
<li>The hostages are bargaining chips. They may have symbolic value (as 
at the 1972 Munich Olympics, in which the target was the Israeli 
government and the hostages were Israeli athletes), but the hostages 
themselves could be anyone.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hostage situations move through several distinct phases:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Initial Phase</strong>&nbsp;– This phase is violent and 
brief and lasts as long as it takes for the hostage-takers to make their
 assault and subdue the hostages. The end of this phase is often marked 
by the presentation of the hostage-takers’ demands.</li>
<li><strong>Negotiation Phase</strong>&nbsp;– At this point, 
law-enforcement officials are on the scene, and the demands have 
probably been received. This phase can last hours, days or months and 
could also be referred to as “the standoff phase.” Physically, nothing 
about the situation changes greatly. The hostages and the hostage-takers
 stay in the same place. However, a lot is happening during this phase 
in terms of the relationships developing between everyone involved. The 
negotiator’s job boils down to manipulating those relationships in a way
 that results in a peaceful ending.</li>
<li><strong>Termination Phase</strong>&nbsp;– This is the brief, sometimes violent final phase. This phase has one of three results:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The hostage-takers surrender peacefully and are arrested.</li>
<li>Police assault the hostage-takers and kill or arrest them.</li>
<li>The hostage-takers’ demands are granted, and they escape.</li>
</ul>
<p>The fate of the hostages does not necessarily depend on what happens 
during the termination phase. Even if the hostage-takers give up, they 
may have killed hostages during the negotiations. Often, hostages are 
killed either accidentally by police or intentionally by their captors 
during an assault. There have even been cases in which the 
hostage-takers were granted their demands, but they killed a hostage 
anyway (Aston, pg. 23).</p>
<p>There is also a post-incident stage in which the effects of the 
incident play themselves out. These effects can include changes in the 
status of the groups responsible, shifts in the relationships between 
world governments or increases in security.</p>
<p>Now that we’ve seen how most hostage situations are similar, we’ll 
take a look at the ways in which some hostage incidents differ from 
others.</p>
<p><strong>Hostage-takers</strong></p>
<p>One of the first things a negotiator does when he or she arrives on 
the scene of a hostage crisis is find out as much as possible about the 
hostage-taker. The most basic question is: Why did this person take a 
hostage? There are a few common reasons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>The hostage-taker might be&nbsp;<strong>emotionally or mentally disturbed</strong>.
 His or her specific reason for taking a hostage may be illogical. He or
 she may be suicidal. This is the only type of hostage situation in 
which the hostage is often related to the hostage-taker. This type of 
hostage situation is unplanned.</li>
</ul>
<p>According to&nbsp;<strong>Lt. Gary Schmidt</strong>&nbsp;of the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.howstuffworks.com/framed.htm?parent=hostage-negotiation.htm&amp;url=http://www.cpdny.org/"><strong>Cheektowaga Police Department</strong></a>&nbsp;in
 Cheektowaga, NY, this is the type of hostage situation the average 
police officer faces most often. “Most of the time, it’s a single person
 involved in a domestic dispute, barricaded in a home. The hostages are 
family members in the same building.”</p>
<ul>
<li>Some criminals use innocent bystanders as&nbsp;<strong>human shields</strong>&nbsp;to
 protect themselves from the police. In most cases, this happens when a 
criminal is caught, panics and grabs a hostage to help himself escape. 
In rare cases, hostages are part of a plan used by professional 
criminals to aid in their escape, but usually, it is unplanned.</li>
<li>The most famous hostage situations in history have been the result 
of carefully planned attacks by terrorists and radical political groups.
 The hostage-takers intend from the beginning to&nbsp;<strong>trade</strong>&nbsp;the
 lives of the hostages for whatever specific goals they want to achieve.
 These can range from changes in one or more countries’ political 
policies, the release of political prisoners or the repeal of specific 
laws. Terrorist groups may also have goals that they will achieve 
regardless of the outcome: destabilizing the target of their attack and 
attracting attention to their cause.</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>Kidnapping is a form of hostage crisis, but it doesn’t resemble a 
typical hostage situation in which the hostage-takers are barricaded in a
 known area. Kidnappers keep their hostage in a secret location, and 
communication is often one-way — the kidnappers tell the authorities 
what to do. As a result, there isn’t much negotiating.</p>
<p>Regardless of the hostage-taker’s motivation, the basic element of 
negotiating remains the same. “You work to build a rapport and encourage
 them to bring about a peaceful conclusion. The same techniques are used
 whenever someone is in crisis,” said Lt. Schmidt.</p>
<p>In the next section, we’ll find out what a negotiator does at the scene of a hostage situation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Negotiator Arrives on the Scene</strong></p>
<p>At the scene of any hostage crisis, the two most important officials are the&nbsp;<strong>commander</strong>, who has authority over the entire scene and all the personnel involved, and the&nbsp;<strong>negotiator</strong>,
 who communicates directly with the hostage-takers. It is vital that 
these two positions are not held by the same person (Antokol, pg.134). 
The negotiator has to keep an objective point of view and remain calm, 
both of which can be difficult if he or she is simultaneously making 
command decisions. Also, one of the negotiator’s most useful tactics is 
to cause delays by telling hostage-takers that higher authorities must 
be consulted before a decision can be made or a concession offered. If 
the negotiator is the highest authority at the scene, this obviously 
won’t work.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The negotiator’s first priority at the beginning of a negotiation is 
to gather information. A lot of information will come from other 
officers at the scene who have scouted the area or run background checks
 on the hostage-takers, but the negotiator can learn a lot from the 
hostage-takers themselves. The negotiator must find out who the 
hostage-takers are, why they are holding people hostage, what their 
demands are and who their leader is, if there is more than one. At the 
same time, the negotiator is paying close attention to the 
hostage-taker’s responses, mannerisms and general attitude in order to 
create a rough <strong>psychological profile</strong>. This can give the
 negotiator some clues as to how the hostage-taker might respond to 
certain situations – a negotiator deals very differently with a 
depressed, suicidal captor than with a cold, rational pragmatist.</p>

<p align="center">Accidental Negotiators</p>
<p>Negotiators in hostage situations are not always trained 
professionals. Sometimes, a bystander just happens to get involved – 
maybe because the person can translate between different languages or 
simply because he or she answered a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.howstuffworks.com/telephone.htm">phone</a>.
 In 1975, the terrorist group Japanese Red Army attacked the U.S. 
Consulate in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The terrorists made a phone call to
 notify U.S. authorities that they had hostages, and a junior embassy 
officer had the misfortune of picking up the phone. The Japanese Red 
Army agents refused to speak with anyone else throughout the crisis 
(Antokol, pg. 135).</p>
<p>When possible, law-enforcement officials bring in a professional negotiator to coach these “reluctant negotiators” along.</p></td>

<p><strong>Negotiator Objectives and Tactics</strong></p>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="1" align="right" width="200">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p align="center">Team Work</p>
<p>Hostage negotiators may work in teams, with a primary and a secondary
 negotiator. The secondary negotiator listens in on all the 
communications between police and the hostage-taker, takes notes and 
then provides support, coaching and suggestions to the primary 
negotiator. Sometimes, the primary just “gets stuck” and can’t think of 
the correct thing to say, so the secondary can provide assistance.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The primary objectives of a negotiator are:</p>
<p><strong>Prolong the situation.</strong><br>
The longer a hostage situation lasts, the more likely that it will end 
peacefully. Tactics include stalling while an official with more 
authority is consulted, getting deadlines pushed back, focusing the 
hostage-takers’ attention on details such as what type of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.howstuffworks.com/airplane.htm">airplane</a>&nbsp;they want and asking them open-ended questions rather than yes/no questions.</p>
<p><strong>Ensure the safety of the hostages.</strong><br>
This means convincing the hostage-taker to allow medical treatment or 
release for sick or injured hostages, negotiating the delivery of food 
and water and negotiating the release of as many hostages as possible. 
Getting some of the hostages out of the situation not only ensures their
 safety, but it also simplifies the situation in the event that an armed
 assault becomes necessary. In addition, released hostages can provide 
invaluable information about the locations and habits of the captors and
 the other hostages.</p>
<p><strong>Keep things calm.</strong><br>
From the initial assault through the first hours of negotiations, 
hostage-takers can be extremely volatile. They’re usually angry about 
whatever perceived injustice has led them to take hostages, and they are
 filled with adrenaline following the excitement of their attack. Angry,
 excited people with&nbsp;<a href="http://www.howstuffworks.com/machine-gun.htm">machine guns</a>&nbsp;are
 not good for hostages. The negotiator should never argue with a 
hostage-taker and never say no to a demand. Instead, the negotiator 
should use delaying tactics or make a counter-offer. Above all, the 
negotiator should keep a positive, upbeat attitude, reassuring the 
hostage-taker that everything will eventually work out peacefully.</p>
<p><strong>Foster the growth of relationships between negotiator and hostage-taker and between hostage-taker and hostages</strong>.<br>
The negotiator must seem credible to the captor. That is, the negotiator
 must act like he or she understands the reasons for the hostage-taker’s
 actions but still come across as strong – not just eager to please. The
 negotiator can also encourage activities that require cooperation and 
interaction between the captors and the hostages, such as sending food 
and medical supplies in bulk packages that have to be prepared. When the
 hostage-taker gets to know the hostages and sees them as human beings, 
it becomes more difficult to execute them. In a 1975 hostage standoff on
 a train in Holland, a hostage, Robert de Groot, who had been chosen for
 death, was spared after the terrorists heard him pray for his wife and 
children. Some of the hostage-takers wept, and two of them agreed to 
avoid a lethal shot when they pushed him out of the train. He rolled 
down an embankment unscathed, played dead and escaped a short while 
later (Barker, pg. 33). When the terrorists selected other hostages for 
execution, they didn’t allow prayer and killed them quickly to avoid the
 emotional strain.</p>
<p>Next, we’ll find out how negotiators balance hostage safety with political reality.</p>

<tr>
<td>
<p align="center">Stockholm Syndrome</p>
<p>Spending hours, days and months together doesn’t only foster feelings
 on the part of the hostage-taker toward the hostages. The hostages 
often develop sympathy for their captors, as well. This is known as 
Stockholm Syndrome, named after a Swedish&nbsp;<a href="http://www.howstuffworks.com/bank.htm">bank</a>&nbsp;heist
 gone wrong that resulted in a six-day stand-off. The hostages ended up 
assisting the robber, acting as lookouts and giving him advice, while 
gradually coming to view the police outside as their common enemy. One 
of the female hostages even married him while he was still in prison.</p>
<p>There are complicated psychological reasons for Stockholm Syndrome. 
It is in part a defense mechanism that allows people to cope with an 
otherwise unbearable situation. It also has something to do with power –
 the hostage-taker has the power to kill the hostages, and when he 
doesn’t, the hostages’ relief can turn into gratitude, which eventually 
develops into sympathy. Also, fear of the police rushing into the 
situation and killing the hostages accidentally in a shootout is very 
powerful and helps turn the hostages against the authorities.</p></td>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Making a Deal</strong></p>
<p>At the beginning of a hostage crisis, the hostage-takers’ demands are
 often unreasonable. They might ask for huge sums of money or for the 
release of thousands of fellow terrorists from jails. Of course, the 
negotiator can’t just give them anything they ask for, even if it would 
mean safety for the hostages. The policies of any nations involved, the 
ability to actually acquire the items being demanded and the need to 
consult with the situation commander and high-ranking political 
officials all limit what a negotiator can offer to the hostage-takers. 
Plus, if anyone who took hostages immediately had all of his or her 
demands granted, the world would face one hostage crisis after another.</p>
<p>However, the negotiator can “chip away” at the situation by offering 
minor concessions, such as food and water, promises of transportation 
and media coverage. In return, the hostage-takers can trade some of the 
hostages or some of their weapons or agree to downgrade some of their 
demands. By continuing this process, the negotiator can gradually weaken
 the hostage-takers’ position.</p>
<p>Most countries have official policies regarding negotiating with 
terrorists. However, these policies shift with time, and they tend to be
 flexible depending on the situation. If the hostages are children or 
important political officials, even the most hard-line non-negotiating 
government might make an exception. In many cases, secret deals are made
 that allow the government to accept demands and save the hostages but 
maintain their public hard-line stance against giving in to terrorists’ 
demands.</p>
<p>Israel, the United States and Russia are all nations that have a 
reputation for strict non-negotiation policies. However, every policy is
 open to exceptions. One example is the 1985 hijacking of TWA Flight 
847. The Hezbollah hijackers demanded the release of more than 700 
Shiites who were in Israeli prisons. After a long ordeal, all the 
hostages were released (except one American, who was murdered by the 
hijackers), and Israel released all 766 prisoners.</p>

<p align="center">The 1972 Munich Olympics</p>
<p>The assault and siege of the Olympic Village at the 1972 Munich 
summer games was triggered by a snub: Two letters had been sent to 
Olympic officials requesting that Palestinian athletes be recognized and
 allowed to participate. Neither letter was acknowledged. On September 
5, a group calling itself Black September killed several Israeli 
athletes and coaches in the process of securing nine Israeli hostages.</p>
<p>Negotiations lasted less than 24 hours as the hostage-takers demanded
 the release of hundreds of Palestinians from prisons in Europe and the 
Middle East. Negotiators pushed back deadlines repeatedly until 10 p.m.,
 when West German officials realized that they could not meet the 
terrorists’ demands. They granted the hostage-takers’ request for a bus 
to take them to two&nbsp;<a href="http://www.howstuffworks.com/helicopter.htm">helicopters</a>,
 which would take them to an airport. There, they would board a plane. 
The Germans knew their only chance at a successful assault would come at
 the airport (Aston, pg. 80).</p>
<p>The ensuing gun and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.howstuffworks.com/grenade.htm">grenade</a>&nbsp;fight,
 which occurred shortly after the helicopters landed at the airport, 
left all the hostages dead, as well as a police officer and a pilot. 
Five of the terrorists were killed, and three were captured.</p></td>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Not Making a Deal</strong></p>
<p>Although refusing to negotiate with terrorists is often a politically
 popular idea (no one wants to “give in” to terrorists), it can be 
disastrous. Even if the government has no intention of granting the 
demands, the process of negotiating itself is vital to achieving a 
peaceful resolution. Two of the most horrific hostage incidents in 
history ended in tragedy in large part due to Russia’s outright refusal 
to negotiate with Muslim Chechen separatists.</p>
<p>In October 2002, armed terrorists took over a Russian theater, 
threatening to blow it up if their demands for a Russian withdrawal from
 the Chechen region weren’t met by the deadline. The Russians waited 
several days before appointing an official government envoy to conduct 
the negotiations, and then decided to storm the theater using “knockout 
gas” instead of negotiating further. In the end, 129 hostages died, 
almost all of them due to the poisonous gas [<a href="http://www.howstuffworks.com/framed.htm?parent=hostage-negotiation.htm&amp;url=http://www.ccc.nps.navy.mil/si/may03/russia.asp">ref</a>].
 Although poor planning and a lack of proper medical care has been 
blamed for the high death toll, further negotiations may have been able 
to reduce the number of casualties.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, history repeated itself in 2004, when Chechen 
separatists invaded the Beslan elementary school with an arsenal of guns
 and bombs. Again, the Russians resorted to an armed assault with tragic
 results. The hostage-takers blew up the gymnasium where most of the 
hostages were being held. More than 300 hostages were killed, more than 
half of them children.</p>
<p>In contrast, France had a reputation in the 1970s and ‘80s as a 
nation that was willing to negotiate and make deals with terrorists. The
 result was that France became a prime target for terrorists attacks, 
and terrorist groups that had agreements with the French government 
regularly broke those agreements.</p>
<p>Next, we’ll examine a case study of a hostage negotiation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Case Study: Princes Gate</h1>
<p>In April 1980, members of the Democratic Revolutionary Movement for 
the Liberation of Arabistan took over an embassy at Princes Gate in 
London, England. The terrorists took 26 hostages in their quest to 
liberate the Iranian province of Arabistan.</p>
<p>Negotiators kept the terrorists’ leader talking for three days, 
giving him media coverage of his demands (despite a botched reporting 
job by the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.howstuffworks.com/framed.htm?parent=hostage-negotiation.htm&amp;url=http://www.bbc.com">BBC</a>&nbsp;that
 sent him into a rage) and winning the release of two ill hostages. They
 earned his trust and got him to relax several deadlines. They also kept
 him focused on the micromanagement of small details, such as the type 
of bus he wanted, what kind of food to bring in and other minor matters.</p>
<p>Throughout the standoff, police were working to obtain intelligence 
about the inside of the building, a complex layout of offices. 
Information came from released hostages, food deliveries and cameras and
 microphones hung down chimneys or through walls.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the terrorists executed one hostage (reportedly 
because he debated the merits of Islam with them), which forced British 
forces into action. They combined a carefully planned assault with a 
distraction provided by the negotiator. This was a breach of standard 
protocol – usually, negotiators are not told when there is going to be 
an attack because it is too difficult for the negotiator to avoid giving
 anything away through tone of voice or choice of words. In this case, 
however, keeping the terrorist leader on the phone would keep him away 
from the windows, giving the troops some extra time to get into the 
building before the hostage-takers discovered the attack [<a href="http://www.howstuffworks.com/framed.htm?parent=hostage-negotiation.htm&amp;url=http://www.specialoperations.com/Counterterrorism/nimrod.html">ref</a>].</p>
<p>The assault was a relative success. The terrorists killed one hostage
 when they realized they were under attack, and the remaining hostages 
escaped the building alive. British forces killed five terrorists during
 the assault, including the leader, and arrested the sixth.</p>

<p align="center">By the Book</p>
<p>Lt. Schmidt described a relatively “typical” incident that was 
resolved peacefully because the crisis negotiators followed their 
training. The first phone call came from a woman who was involved in a 
domestic dispute with her husband, who was angry and carrying a handgun.
 Although he had not pointed it at her, she was frightened and secretly 
called the police from another part of the house.</p>
<p>When the Cheektowaga police responded, they deployed their tactical 
unit, which is a S.W.A.T. team, to set up a perimeter around the house. A
 tactical support unit, which sets up communications equipment, handles 
logistics and includes the negotiators, backed up the S.W.A.T. team. 
Whenever possible, the tactical support unit uses two negotiators, a 
primary and a secondary negotiator. In this case, Lt. Schmidt was acting
 as the secondary.</p>
<p>They made contact by phone with the hostage-taker and continued 
negotiating with him for several hours. The negotiator built up a 
rapport with him by discussing the marital problems that had lead to his
 “crisis point.” Although he had still not fired the gun or aimed it at 
anyone, he had made threats to use it, so there was a real danger to the
 hostage and police. In the end, because they had built a relationship 
with the hostage-taker, they were able to convince him to leave the gun 
inside the house and come to the front door to surrender. “It’s very 
important to get them to leave their weapons behind when they 
surrender,” said Lt. Schmidt.</p>
<p>The S.W.A.T. team took the hostage-taker into custody without incident.</p></td>

<p><strong>Becoming a Hostage Negotiator</strong></p>
<p>The path to becoming a professional hostage negotiator can be a 
winding one. There are training courses and certifications, but an 
important aspect of dealing with a crisis is experience. Someone fresh 
out of college could take every negotiator training course ever offered 
and still not get a job as a negotiator. The bedrock of a negotiator’s 
career is several years working as a law-enforcement officer (whether 
with the police department, FBI or other law-enforcement group) or in 
the military and dealing with crisis situations on a regular basis. “You
 hone your skills as an officer, because you talk to people all the 
time. A lot of the people you talk to, while not in an ‘official 
crisis,’ are in some kind of crisis situation,” said Lt. Schmidt. “You 
learn a lot just from active listening and interacting with people.”</p>

<p>Education and training is important as well, and there are plenty of 
courses being offered to help police officers, FBI agents, military 
personnel and others learn how to negotiate in a hostage situation. The 
Public Agency Training Council (PATC), a private company that offers 
training courses to law-enforcement agencies, has courses on dealing 
with emotionally unstable persons, specific tactics for use in 
negotiations and complete negotiator courses (see&nbsp;<a href="http://www.howstuffworks.com/framed.htm?parent=hostage-negotiation.htm&amp;url=http://www.patc.com/courses/hostage.shtml">PATC: Hostage Courses</a>). The International Association of Hostage Negotiators also sponsors seminars and training courses (see&nbsp;<a href="http://www.howstuffworks.com/framed.htm?parent=hostage-negotiation.htm&amp;url=http://www.hostagenegotiation.com/web/HostageNegotiation_v2/TrainingInformation.asp">Training Schedule and Information</a>).</p>
<p>A hostage negotiator’s training is never complete. The FBI and other 
agencies offer recurring training seminars. The Cheektowaga Police 
Department’s crisis negotiators have teamed up with other 
law-enforcement agencies in their region to form an association that 
meets several times each year to offer critiques, suggestions and 
support.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>NEGOTIATION STYLES</strong></p>
<p><strong>Negotiation styles</strong> vary with the person, their 
beliefs and skills, as well as the general context in which they occur. 
Here are a number of different styles considered from different 
viewpoints.</p>
<h2>Belief-based styles</h2>
<p>There is a common&nbsp;<a href="http://changingminds.org/disciplines/negotiation/styles/spectrum_negotiation.htm">spectrum</a>&nbsp;of negotiation that ranges from collaborative to competitive. The approach taken is generally based on</p>

<li><a href="http://changingminds.org/disciplines/negotiation/styles/balanced_negotiation.htm">Balanced negotiation</a>: Walking between collaborative and competitive negotiation.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Professional styles</h2>
<p>Professional styles are those use by people who have a significant 
element of negotiation in their roles. Here is a selection of different 
contexts in which such negotiation takes place.</p>

<li><a href="http://changingminds.org/disciplines/negotiation/styles/hostage_negotiations.htm">Hostage</a>: Emotional big-stakes exchanges.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Contextual styles</h2>
<p>Negotiation often happens within non-professional contexts, where the
 people either do not know that they are negotiating or they are not 
skilled at it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><strong>8 stages of negotiation process</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a unique combination framework that puts together the best of
 many other approaches to negotiation. It is particularly suited to more
 complex, higher-value and slower negotiations.</p>
<ol start="1">
<li><a href="http://changingminds.org/disciplines/negotiation/eight-stage/prepare.htm">Prepare</a>: Know what you want. Understand them.</li>
<li><a href="http://changingminds.org/disciplines/negotiation/eight-stage/open.htm">Open</a>: Put your case. Hear theirs.</li>
<li><a href="http://changingminds.org/disciplines/negotiation/eight-stage/argue.htm">Argue</a>: Support your case. Expose theirs.</li>
<li><a href="http://changingminds.org/disciplines/negotiation/eight-stage/explore.htm">Explore</a>: Seek understanding and possibility.</li>
<li><a href="http://changingminds.org/disciplines/negotiation/eight-stage/signal.htm">Signal</a>: Indicate your readiness to work together.</li>
<li><a href="http://changingminds.org/disciplines/negotiation/eight-stage/package.htm">Package</a>: Assemble potential trades.</li>
<li><a href="http://changingminds.org/disciplines/negotiation/eight-stage/close.htm">Close</a>: Reach final agreement.</li>
<li><a href="http://changingminds.org/disciplines/negotiation/eight-stage/sustain.htm">Sustain</a>: Make sure what is agreed happens.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are deliberately a larger number of stages in this process as 
it is designed to break down important activities during negotiation, 
particularly towards the end. It is an easy trap to try to jump to the 
end with a solution that is inadequate and unacceptable.</p>
<p>Note also that in practice, you may find variations on these, for 
example there may be loops back to previous stages, stages overlapping, 
stages running parallel and even out of order.</p>
<p>The bottom line is to&nbsp;<em>use what works</em>. This process is 
intended to help you negotiate, but do not use it blindly. It is not 
magic and is not a substitute for thinking. If something does not seem 
to be working, try to figure out why and either fix the problem or try 
something else. Although there are commonalities across negotiations, 
each one is different and the greatest skill is to be able to read the 
situation in the moment and adapt as appropriate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Three-stage negotiation</strong> process is a quick and 
easy method of reaching agreement in the many different short situations
 you may find yourself in where the&nbsp;<a href="http://changingminds.org/disciplines/negotiation/eight-stage/eight-stage.htm">eight-stage negotiation process</a>&nbsp;is too complex a process for you.</p>
<p>Typical situations where a short negotiation is used includes domestics requests and retail purchases.</p>
<p>The three stages are simply:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://changingminds.org/disciplines/negotiation/three-stage/open.htm">Open</a>: Say what you want</li>
<li><a href="http://changingminds.org/disciplines/negotiation/three-stage/bargain.htm">Bargain</a>: Hammer out the deal</li>
<li><a href="http://changingminds.org/disciplines/negotiation/three-stage/close.htm">Close</a>: Agree and exchange</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><strong>HOSTAGE NEGOTIATION </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;Hostage negotiation happens when a criminal uses innocent 
people as bargaining chips. This can happen in a range of circumstances,
 including:</p>
<ul>
<li>A desperate mother who barricades herself in with her own child.</li>
<li>A bank robber who is disturbed on the job.</li>
<li>Terrorists who take foreign nationals.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus:</p>
<ul>
<li>There may be one or more hostages of any age</li>
<li>The situation may be planned or ad hoc.</li>
<li>There may be one or more hostage-takers, who are usually armed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fortunately for most of us, we never meet these situations. 
Fortunately for those who become hostages, there are professionals whose
 job it is to get them safely released.</p>
<h2>Assessing the situation</h2>
<h3>Preventing early harm</h3>
<p>The first job of the hostage negotiator is to create safety. When 
they arrive on the scene, there may be armed police, high emotion and 
general confusion in which hostages may get hurt.</p>
<p>Their immediate task is to get a swift briefing from the officer in 
charge and to ensure that any actions by the police do not lead to 
hostages being harmed. The police (or whatever authority is in charge) 
will have a high interest in capturing the hostage-taker, whilst the 
negotiator is only interested in the safety of the hostages.</p>
<h3>Getting organized</h3>
<p>The next step is to organize communications with the hostage-takers. 
Hostage-takers usually want this, to make their demands known. If the 
negotiation looks like it could take some time (which may be days or 
more), then a permanent position must be found.</p>
<p>There may also be covert monitoring, for example with window lasers 
and hidden cameras. Everything that provides information is used, 
including relatives, friends and other sources.</p>
<h3>Finding information</h3>
<p>The negotiator will want to find as much information about the situation as possible, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The numbers and names of the hostage-takers.</li>
<li>What they are demanding&nbsp;<em>and&nbsp;</em>what they&nbsp;<em>really&nbsp;</em>want.</li>
<li>Their emotional state and how close they are to harming hostages.</li>
<li>The numbers and general health of hostages.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of this information may be available from the authorities. Other
 will be gained from the hostage-takers. In the early conversation with 
them, which is very much about listening, the negotiators may find out 
much of this. Some other information may take a while to extract.</p>
<p>The hostage-takers will want to make their demands known, but may be 
very cagey with other information as they fear deception and attack.</p>
<p>The police will also want all information, including the location of 
everyone in the situation, in case an armed assault is required.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Getting close</h2>
<p>A critical process used in many hostage negotiations is to get close to them, to gain their trust.</p>
<h3>Creating normality</h3>
<p>Whilst there may be chaos and panic on all sides, the negotiator 
first seeks to create calm. They talk in a calm voice and do a great 
deal of listening. In particular, they seek to establish a sense of 
normality amongst the emotion, a space in which the hostage-takers can 
talk with the negotiator as reasonable people, much as you would talk 
with any normal person on the phone.</p>
<p>The negotiator is always there and always ready to talk. They will 
listen to everything and will create an even keel on which reasonable 
negotiation can be conducted.</p>
<h3>Creating humanity</h3>
<p>Within the normality, the negotiator listens uncritically to the 
hostage-taker, accepting them as they are and creating a sense of 
humanity. From that humanity, they then can extend to discussing the 
hostages, how they are bearing up and whether they are unwell.</p>
<h3>Developing authority</h3>
<p>The negotiator may also seek to position themselves as an authority 
figure. This may start by being authoritative on behalf of the 
hostage-taker, for example in getting them communications and food. This
 may later turn to being authoritative&nbsp;<em>with&nbsp;</em>the 
hostage-taker. This can be a tricky and dangerous activity, as the 
hostage-taker wants to be in charge. Authoritative work may thus be done
 in particular circumstances. Nevertheless, if the negotiators can 
establish this relationship, they may be able to direct the 
hostage-taker’s actions more effectively.</p>
<h2>Developing the scene</h2>
<p>Once a relationship is established, the negotiator can seek to move the situation forward.</p>
<h3>Small steps</h3>
<p>Progress may be in small steps, as trust and relationships continue 
to be built. Food and medicine may be given. Conversation with a hostage
 may be requested. Everyday chat creates normality.</p>
<p>Depending on the urgency of the situation, the negotiator may seek to
 speed up or slow down the talking. If hostages are hurt, then speed may
 be needed. If the hostage-takers are requiring transport or other 
things that would lead to more problems, then it may be more prudent to 
insert delays, such as saying you are ‘looking into it’.</p>
<h3>Managing stress</h3>
<p>Stress and tension will continue throughout the negotiation in some 
way. The negotiator may deliberately manage this, reducing stress to 
create hostage safety, but also possibly increasing stress to wear down 
the hostage-taker.</p>
<h3>Exploring solutions</h3>
<p>Talks will eventually get around to what can be done to resolve the 
situation. The negotiator may ask the hostage-taker for their thoughts 
and may offer possibilities themselves. Of course the safe release of 
the hostages is always an important element.</p>
<p>The goal of the hostage taker may be simply to escape and may be for 
publicity or other gain. If this is not acceptable to the authorities, 
for example release of a captured terrorist leader, then other 
alternatives must be found.</p>
<h2>Releasing the hostages</h2>
<h3>Wearing them down</h3>
<p>Sometimes, just talk, talk, talk is enough to wear down the 
hostage-takers and for them to give themselves up. High emotions do not 
last for ever and are followed by exhaustion. The ideal negotiation thus
 ends with the hostage-taker agreeing to let everyone go.</p>
<h3>Releasing the weak</h3>
<p>Depending on the number of people taken hostage, a release of 
children, old people and those with medical conditions may be 
negotiated. It allows the hostage-takers to show that they are not ‘bad’
 people after all and also rids them of the problems of illness and 
wailing children.</p>
<h3>Concessions for people</h3>
<p>People may also be exchanged for various concessions, from food to 
publicity. When something is given to the hostage-takers, especially if 
it is on their list of demands, then a concession may be requested in 
return, with the ultimate concession of hostage release.</p>
<h3>The final assault</h3>
<p>It is a very delicate balance for the negotiator when no clear 
exchange can be found and the hostage-takers look like they are going to
 kill hostages. Whilst they are seeking to create exchange, the 
negotiator must also find the point at which they pull the plugs and let
 the armed forces take over. Even though some hostages may be killed, 
force may ultimately be the best solution to minimize total harm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><strong>APPRECIATING TRUSTWORTHINESS</strong></p>
<p><strong>Trust</strong> is the key to the door of other people’s 
minds. If they don’t trust you, then you haven’t a hope in Hades of 
persuading them. If they do trust you, it doesn’t necessarily mean you 
can persuade them, but at least they will now listen to you and take you
 seriously.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So manage trust carefully. It can, as they say, take a lifetime to 
build and a moment to lose. And the simplest way to do this is to be 
trustworthy. Be dependable. Care about people. Deception may persuade 
people for now, but the cost of being found out can be extremely high.</p>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, manage your own stress. Listen to your body. Spot the&nbsp;<a href="http://changingminds.org/explanations/stress/stress_symptoms.htm">symptoms</a>.
 Then find ways of reducing it. Relax, exercise, eat well. When you are 
feeing stressed, take a break. Under excessive stress, you are not at 
your best — in fact you are near your worst. A bit of stress is ok, but 
too much is very&nbsp;<a href="http://changingminds.org/explanations/brain/dysfunction/gas.htm">bad for you</a>.</p>
<p>Stress is also a key tool in persuasion, and creating&nbsp;<a href="http://changingminds.org/principles/tension.htm">tension</a>&nbsp;happens
 in virtually all persuasive situations. The trick is to manage that 
stress: too much and the person will crack. Too little and they will not
 change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><strong>UNDERSTANDING STRESS</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>STRESS</strong> is something that affects us all. If we can 
learn to recognize it, then we can learn to manage it. Management of 
stress often seeks to reduce it in ourselves, friends and clients. It 
also can be a tool for motivation and persuasion, as increasing&nbsp;<a href="http://changingminds.org/principles/tension.htm">tension</a>&nbsp;also increase the desire to reduce it. It thus be used, with care, to effectively move both ourselves and others.</p>
<h2>The effects of stress</h2>
<p>The effects of stress on us are physical, cognitive and behavioral. 
Gaining a good understanding of these things will place you well over 
half-way towards being able to manage them.</p>
<p>Stress&nbsp;<a href="http://changingminds.org/explanations/stress/stress_symptoms.htm">affects our bodies</a>&nbsp;and thoughts and can eventually&nbsp;<a href="http://changingminds.org/explanations/brain/dysfunction/gas.htm">kill us</a>. It triggers&nbsp;<a href="http://changingminds.org/explanations/brain/fight_flight.htm">primitive reactions</a>and we&nbsp;<a href="http://changingminds.org/explanations/behaviors/coping/coping.htm">cope</a>&nbsp;with it in ways that are often dysfunctional.</p>
<h2>Stress management</h2>
<p>The effects of stress on us are physical, cognitive and behavioral. 
To manage stress, you can do it either from the outside, physically, or 
from the inside, transforming stress into a positive force for good.</p>
<h3>Physical relaxation</h3>
<p>Stress occurs in the body, felt as physical muscular tension. It also
 works backwards. Acting to relax the body also acts to relax the mind. 
There are two ways to relax physically: exercise and direct relaxation.</p>
<p>Physical exercise works by giving the body the workout that it is 
designed to receive. The body then does the relaxing that it is supposed
 to do also. When muscles are tired, they are forced to let go and 
relax. Exercise can also be gentler, and combined with meditative 
techniques, such as Tai Chi and Yoga.</p>
<p>Listening to relaxing music also helps. Classical music such as by 
Mozart and Pachobel is better than energetic pop or jazz (which is no 
better than silence). Energetic music can help if it acts to distract 
you from stressful thoughts.</p>
<p>Direct relaxation is at the floppy end of the scale, and is usually done in conjunction with something that&nbsp;<a href="http://changingminds.org/principles/distraction.htm">distracts</a>&nbsp;the
 mind from those things that are causing stress. Thus watching a movie 
or reading a book whilst ensconced in a nice comfortable armchair 
(perhaps with a beer in your hand) is a great method for many people.</p>
<h3>Making stress positive</h3>
<p><a href="http://changingminds.org/explanations/behaviors/coping/sublimation.htm">Sublimation</a>&nbsp;is
 the method we use when we displace negative stresses into positive and 
useful actions. Thus we can take the tension of being a student and use 
it to motivate ourselves to work hard, or take the frustrations of work 
and sublimate these into a useful and creative hobby.</p>
<p>Stress can also be converted to a positive force by gaining a deeper 
understanding of the people who are causing stress for you. When you 
realize that much of their behavior towards you is actually&nbsp;<a href="http://changingminds.org/explanations/behaviors/coping/displacement.htm">displaced</a>&nbsp;frustrations about themselves, you can convert your own&nbsp;<a href="http://changingminds.org/explanations/emotions/fear.htm">fear</a>&nbsp;and<a href="http://changingminds.org/explanations/emotions/anger.htm">anger</a>&nbsp;into genuine concern for them.</p>
<h2>Using stress to persuade</h2>
<p>Using stress to persuade is pretty much how persuasion works. 
Virtually all persuasive activities involve manipulation of stress 
levels, whether this is realized or not. For example, the&nbsp;<a href="http://changingminds.org/principles/hurt_rescue.htm">Hurt and Rescue principle</a>&nbsp;appears in many different forms of persuasion.&nbsp;<a href="http://changingminds.org/explanations/behaviors/conditioning/conditioning.htm">Conditioning</a>&nbsp;involves&nbsp;<a href="http://changingminds.org/principles/association.htm">association</a>of stress and comfort with undesirable and desirable things.</p>
<p>The biggest trick in using stress is in the appropriate levels being used. Too much and you will trigger the&nbsp;<a href="http://changingminds.org/explanations/brain/fight_flight.htm">Fight-or-Flight reaction</a>.
 Too little and you will not get any motivated response. To find the 
right level of stress requires a great deal of attention and 
sensitivity. People who lack empathy often go about motivating others 
with a sledge-hammer, and consequently largely are unsuccessful.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>HURT AND RESCUE PRINCIPLE</strong></p>
<h2>Principle</h2>
<p>‘A drowning person will clutch at a straw’, so push them in the water, then throw them a rope.</p>
<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>‘Hurt and Rescue’ is the underlying principle beneath many different persuasion methods.</p>
<h3>Hurt</h3>
<p>Hurting the other person does not mean physical harm and it may not 
even mean making them feel bad, but it does mean creating a tension that
 they want to resolve.</p>
<h4>Negative and positive hurt</h4>
<p>Negative hurting means making them feel pain of some kind, pointing 
out what is wrong, making them want to get away from something.</p>
<p>Positive hurt, on the other hand, means making the other person want something, creating desire, seeing what is good.</p>
<h4>Active and passive hurt</h4>
<p>Actively hurting someone means taking deliberate action, setting them up, causing them pain by what you do.</p>
<p>Passive hurt may mean deliberately allowing a person to be hurt when 
you could rescue them earlier (perhaps to have a greater effect later).</p>
<h3>Rescue</h3>
<p>Rescuing a person means removing their hurt, saving themselves from their pains. It creates<a href="http://changingminds.org/principles/closure.htm">closure</a>&nbsp;and relief.</p>
<p>Rescuing can be a bit like fishing. It’s not just about reeling in 
the fish. If they feel you pulling, then they may pull back and you end 
up either with a tug of way or a broken line and a fish disappearing 
into the distance.</p>
<h4>Grasping hopefully at straws</h4>
<p>Rescue may start with&nbsp;<a href="http://changingminds.org/explanations/emotions/hope.htm">hope</a>, as people envisage and predict the relief of being rescued. Thus they will grasp at straws in the desperate hope of rescue.</p>
<h4>Self-rescue</h4>
<p>In the ideal rescue, the solution is available and the person rescues
 themself without your intervention. This can be arranged, for example, 
by putting it in their path and helping them to ‘find’ it. You can then 
be suitably impressed and congratulate them.<br>
A key benefit of self-rescue is that they fully own the solution hence are likely to adopt it more fully.</p>
<h4>Requested rescue</h4>
<p>It helps a great deal if, rather than having rescue thrust upon the 
person, they ask for it first. This helps to ensure they appreciate and 
own the solution.</p>
<h4>Offered rescue</h4>
<p>In practice, it is often necessary for you to offer rescue, such as 
when they cannot see a solution even when it is in front of them.<br>
When doing this, you may get some objections and resistance which you must handle.</p>
<h4>Enforced rescue</h4>
<p>Finally, you may effect the rescue without their permission, for example when they are in imminent danger.<br>
In such cases, they may not realize they are hurt and may strongly resist your rescue attempts.</p>
<p>‘Hurt and Rescue’ seems pretty negative, by the way, but do not be 
fooled by the wording. As with most methods, it can be used for good or 
bad.</p>
<p>Hurt and rescue methods can range from the classic ‘Good cop–bad cop’ routine to the most principled of therapeutic technique.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>THEORIES OF POWER</strong></p>
<p>Here are academic theories about how we gain and use power.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://changingminds.org/explanations/theories/coercion.htm">Coercion</a>: is acting to change a person’s behavior against their will.</li>
<li><a href="http://changingminds.org/explanations/theories/least_interest.htm">Least Interest Principle</a>: the person with the least interest has most power.</li>
<li><a href="http://changingminds.org/explanations/theories/power.htm">Power</a>: is the ability to get a person to change their behavior.</li>
<li><a href="http://changingminds.org/explanations/theories/social_exchange.htm">Social Exchange Theory</a>: give in order to get more.</li>
<li><a href="http://changingminds.org/explanations/theories/strategic_contingencies.htm">Strategic Contingencies Theory</a>: power depends on problem skill, centrality and uniqueness of skill.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Power is the ability to get what you want. As what you want is often 
constrained by other people, the use of power often includes changing or
 influencing what others think, believe and do. It is at the heart of 
all techniques of changing minds.</p>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Understand the power you have as well as the power of other people. 
Use your own power carefully. Perhaps the greatest power you can have is
 to get others to use their power on your behalf.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beware of sleeping dragons: many people will only use their power 
when aroused. The most effective power is that used so subtly that 
people do not realize it is being used.</p>
<p>Power does not have to be used directly: threats are often effective,
 especially when accompanied by displays of power. Like gorillas 
thumping their chests, we seldom need to fight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Power is often expressed in communication as a combination of 
strength and humanity. This is very attractive and is a form of&nbsp;<a href="http://changingminds.org/principles/hurt_rescue.htm">Hurt and Rescue</a>.</p>
<h2>Greeting</h2>
<h3>Handshake</h3>
<p>As the other person approaches, move to left side, extend your arm 
horizontally, palm down (be first to do this). Grab their palm firmly, 
pull them in and hold their elbow with your left hand.</p>
<p>The horizontal arm is an unmissable signal. Palm on top is being 
dominant, putting yourself on top. Holding the elbow further controls 
them.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<em>royal handshake&nbsp;</em>is outstretched arm to keep the other at their distance. A limp hand, palm down, stops them doing a power shake.</p>
<h3>Touching</h3>
<p>Touching is power symbol. Touching people can be threatening, and is used by leaders to demonstrate power.</p>
<p>The handshake is, of course, a touch, and can lead to further touching, such as the elbow grip and patting shoulders and back.</p>
<p>Guide people with a palm in the small of the back. Greet them with a 
hand on the back. Touch them on the elbow or other ‘safe’ areas.</p>
<h2>Speaking</h2>
<h3>Talking</h3>
<p>Talk with confidence and use the body beat in time with assertions. 
Beat with a finger, a palm or even a fist (which is rather aggressive). 
Emphasize and exaggerate your points.</p>
<p>Use silences too. Pause in the middle of speaking and look around at 
everyone. If you are not interrupted they are probably respecting your 
power. Stand confidently without speaking. Look around, gazing into 
people’s eyes for slightly longer than usual.</p>
<h3>Emoting</h3>
<p>It is powerful to show that you have emotion, but in the right place 
only. It shows you are human. At other times it emphasizes how you are 
in control. A neat trick is to bite the lower lip, as it shows both 
emotion and control (Bill Clinton did it 15 times in 2 minutes during 
the Monica Lewinsky ‘confession’).</p>
<h2>And…</h2>
<h3>Walking</h3>
<p>Walk with exaggerated swinging of arms, palm down and out. Kink 
elbows outwards, making the body seem wider. Add a slight swagger.</p>
<p>When walking with others, be in front of them. When going through 
doors, if you are going to an audience, go first. If you are going from 
an audience, go last (guiding others through shows dominance).</p>
<h3>Position</h3>
<p>Generally be higher. Sit on a higher chair. Stand over people. Wear heels. Drive a higher car.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dominant body language is related to&nbsp;<a href="http://changingminds.org/techniques/body/aggressive_body.htm">aggressive body language</a>, though with a less emotional content.</p>
<h2>Size signals</h2>
<p>The body in dominant stances is generally&nbsp;<a href="http://changingminds.org/techniques/body/open_body.htm">open</a>, and may also include additional aspects.</p>
<h3>Making the body big</h3>
<p>Hands on hips makes the elbows go wide and make the body seem larger.
 So also does standing upright and erect, with the chin up and the chest
 thrust out. Legs may be placed apart to increase size.</p>
<h3>Making the body high</h3>
<p>Height is also important as it gives an attack advantage. This can be
 achieved by standing up straight or somehow getting the other person 
lower than you, for example by putting them on a lower seat or by your 
standing on a step or plinth.</p>
<h3>Occupying territory</h3>
<p>By invading and occupying territory that others may own or use, 
control and dominance is indicated. A dominant person may thus stand 
with feet akimbo and hands on hips.</p>
<h2>Superiority signals</h2>
<h3>Breaking social rules</h3>
<p>Rulers do not need to follow rules: they&nbsp;<em>make&nbsp;</em>the 
rules. This power to decide one’s own path is often displayed in 
breaking of social rules, from invasion and interruption to casual 
swearing in polite company.</p>
<h3>Ownership</h3>
<p>Owning something that others covet provides a status symbol. This can
 be territorial, such as a larger office, or displays of wealth or 
power, such as a Rolex watch or having many subordinates.</p>
<p>Just owning things is an initial symbol, but in body language it is 
the flaunting of these, often casually, that is the power display. Thus a
 senior manager will casually take out their Mont Blanc pen whilst 
telling their secretary to fetch the Havana cigars.</p>
<h3>Invasion</h3>
<p>A dominant act is to disrespect the ownership of others, invading 
their territory, for example getting to close to them by moving into 
their&nbsp;<a href="http://changingminds.org/explanations/behaviors/body_language/proxemics.htm">body space</a>.
 Other actions include sitting on their chairs, leaning on their cars, 
putting feet up on their furniture and being over-friendly with their 
romantic partners.</p>
<p>Invasion says ‘What’s yours is mine’ and ‘I can take anything of yours that I want and you cannot stop me’.</p>
<h3>Belittling others</h3>
<p>Superiority signals are found both in saying ‘I am important’ and 
also ‘You are not important’. Thus a dominant person may ignore or 
interrupt another person who is speaking or turn away from them. They 
may also criticize the inferior person, including when the other person 
can hear them.</p>
<h3>Facial signals</h3>
<p>Much dominance can be shown in the&nbsp;<a href="http://changingminds.org/techniques/body/parts_body_language/face_body_language.htm">face</a>, from disapproving frowns and pursed lips to sneers and snarls (sometimes disguised as smiles).</p>
<p>The eyes can be used to stare and hold the gaze for long period. They
 may also squint, preventing the other person seeing where you are 
looking. They may also look at anywhere but the other person, 
effectively saying that ‘you are not even worth looking at’.</p>
<p>Faces can also look bored, amused or express other expressions that belittle the other person.</p>
<p>Dominant people often smile much less than submissive people.</p>
<h3>Phallic displays</h3>
<p>Dominant men will often expose their crotch, effectively saying to 
other men ‘I am safe from attack’ or ‘my penis is bigger than yours’, 
whilst showing off. They may also be offering ‘come and get it!’ to 
women. When women do this, it is to some extent a tease or invitation to
 men but may also be an emulation of the male display, thus saying ‘I am
 as strong as a man’.</p>
<p>This appears in standing or sitting where the legs are apart. It may be emphasized by scratching or adjusting of the crotch.</p>
<h2>The dominant greeting</h2>
<p>When people first meet and&nbsp;<a href="http://changingminds.org/techniques/body/greeting.htm">greet</a>,
 their first interaction sets the pattern for the future relationship. 
When a person is dominant here, then they will most likely continue to 
be dominant.</p>
<h3>The handshake</h3>
<p>A classic dominant handshake is with the palm down, symbolically 
being on top. Another form of dominant handshake is to use strength to 
squeeze the other person.</p>
<p>Holding the other person’s hand for longer than normal also shows that you are in control.</p>
<h3>Eyes</h3>
<p>Prolonged, unblinking&nbsp;<a href="http://changingminds.org/techniques/body/parts_body_language/eyes_body_language.htm">eye</a>&nbsp;contact
 acts like overplaying the handshake — it says ‘I am powerful, I can 
break the rules.’ The dominant person may alternatively prevent eye 
contact, saying ‘You are beneath me and I do not want even to look at 
you.’</p>
<h3>Speaking</h3>
<p>The person who speaks first often gets to control the conversation, either by talking for longer or by managing the questions.</p>
<h2>Responding to dominance</h2>
<p>If others display dominant body language you have a range of options.</p>
<p>The simplest response is simply not to submit, which is what they 
probably want. Continue to appear friendly and ignore their subtle 
signals.</p>
<p>Another response is to fight dominance with dominance, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Out-stare them (a trick here is to look at the bridge of their nose, not their eyes).</li>
<li>Touch them, either before they touch you or immediately when they touch you.</li>
<li>When they do a power handshake, grab their elbow and step to the side.</li>
<li>When they butt in to your speech, speed up, talk more loudly and say ‘let me finish!’</li>
</ul>
<p>Another approach is to name the game. Ask them why they are using 
dominant body language. A good way to do this is in a curious, unafraid 
way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A significant cluster of body movements is used to signal aggression.</p>
<p>This is actually quite useful as it is seldom a good idea to get into
 a fight, even for powerful people. Fighting can hurt you, even though 
you are pretty certain you will win. In addition, with adults, fighting 
is often socially unacceptable and aggression through words and body 
language is all that may ever happen.</p>
<h2>Threat</h2>
<h3>Facial signals</h3>
<p>Much aggression can be shown in the face, from disapproving frowns 
and pursed lips to sneers and full snarls. The eyes can be used to stare
 and hold the gaze for long period. They may also squint, preventing the
 other person seeing where you are looking.</p>
<h3>Attack signals</h3>
<p>When somebody is about to attack, they give visual signal such as 
clenching of fists ready to strike and lowering and spreading of the 
body for stability. They are also likely to give anger signs such as 
redness of the face.</p>
<h3>Exposing oneself</h3>
<p>Exposing oneself to attack is also a form of aggression. It is saying
 ‘Go on – I dare you. I will still win.’ It can include not looking at 
the other person, crotch displays, relaxing the body, turning away and 
so on.</p>
<h2>Invasion</h2>
<p>Invading the space of the other person in some way is an act of aggression that is equivalent to one country invading another.</p>
<h3>False friendship</h3>
<p>Invasion is often done under the cloak of of familiarity, where you 
act as if you are being friendly and move into a space reserved for 
friends, but&nbsp;<em>without being invited</em>. This gives the other person a dilemma of whether to repel a ‘friendly’ advance or to accept dominance of the other.</p>
<h3>Approach</h3>
<p>When you go inside the&nbsp;<a href="http://changingminds.org/techniques/body/social_distance.htm">comfort zone</a>&nbsp;of
 others without permission, you are effectively invading their 
territory. The close you get, the greater your ability to have ‘first 
strike’, from which an opponent may not recover.</p>
<h3>Touching</h3>
<p>Touching the person is another form of invasion. Even touching social touch zones such as arm and back can be aggressive.</p>
<h2>Gestures</h2>
<h3>Insulting gestures</h3>
<p>There are many, many&nbsp;<a href="http://changingminds.org/explanations/behaviors/body_language/gesture_type.htm">gestures</a>&nbsp;that
 have the primary intent of insulting the other person and hence 
inciting them to anger and a perhaps unwise battle. Single and double 
fingers pointed up, arm thrusts, chin tilts and so on are used, although
 many of these do vary across cultures (which can make for hazardous 
accidental movements when you are overseas).</p>
<p>Many gestures are sexual in nature, indicating that the other person 
should go away and fornicate, that you (or someone else) are having sex 
with their partner, and so on.</p>
<h3>Mock attacks</h3>
<p>Gestures may include symbolic action that mimics actual attacks, 
including waving fingers (the beating baton), shaking fists, head-butts,
 leg-swinging and so on. This is saying ‘Here is what I will do to you!’</p>
<p>Physical items may be used as substitutes, for example banging of 
tables and doors or throwing . Again, this is saying ‘This could be 
you!’</p>
<h3>Sudden movements</h3>
<p>All of these gestures may be done suddenly, signaling your level of aggression and testing the other person’s reactions.</p>
<h3>Large gestures</h3>
<p>The size of gestures may also be used to signal levels of aggression,
 from simple finger movements to whole arm sweeps, sometimes even with 
exaggerated movements of the entire body.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gestures, the movement of arms and hands, are different from other 
body language in that they tend to have a far greater association with 
speech and language. Whilst the rest of the body indicates more general 
emotional state, gestures can have specific linguistic content.</p>
<p>Gestures have three phases:&nbsp;<em>preparation, stroke&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>retraction</em>.
 The real message is in the stroke, whilst the preparation and 
retraction elements consist of moving the arms to and from the rest 
position, to and from the start and end of the stroke.</p>
<h2>Emblems</h2>
<p>Emblems are specific gestures with specific meaning that are 
consciously used and consciously understood. They are used as 
substitutes for words and are close to sign language than everyday body 
language.</p>
<p>For example, holding up the hand with all fingers closed in except 
the index and second finger, which are spread apart, can mean ‘V for 
victory’ or ‘peace’ (if the palm is away from the body) or a rather rude
 dismissal if the palm is towards the body.</p>
<h2>Iconic gestures</h2>
<p>Iconic gestures or<em>&nbsp;</em><em>illustrators&nbsp;</em>are 
closely related to speech, illustrating what is being said, painting 
with the hands, for example when a person illustrates a physical item by
 using the hands to show how big or small it is. Iconic gestures are 
different from other gestures in that they are used to show physical, 
concrete items.</p>
<p>Iconic gestures are useful as they add detail to the mental image 
that the person is trying convey. They also show the first person or 
second person&nbsp;<a href="http://changingminds.org/disciplines/communication/models/viewpoint.htm">viewpoint</a>&nbsp;that the person is taking.</p>
<p>The timing of iconic gestures in synchronization with speech can show
 you whether they are unconscious or are being deliberately added for 
conscious effect. In an unconscious usage, the preparation for the 
gesture will start&nbsp;<em>before&nbsp;</em>the words are said, whilst 
in conscious usage there is a small lag between words and gesture (which
 can make the speaker appear manipulative).</p>
<h2>Metaphoric gestures</h2>
<p>When using metaphoric gestures, a concept is being explained. 
Gestures are in three-dimensional space and are used to shape and idea 
being explained, either with specific shapes such as finger pinches and 
physical shaping, or more general waving of hands that symbolizes the 
complexity of what is being explained.</p>
<h2>Regulators</h2>
<p>Regulators are used to control turn-taking in conversation, for 
example in the way that as a person completes what they are saying, they
 may drop their arms, whilst a person wanting to speak may raise an arm 
as if to grasp the way forward.</p>
<h2>Affect displays</h2>
<p>Gestures can also be used to display emotion, from tightening of a 
fist to the many forms of self-touching and holding the self. Covering 
or rubbing eyes, ears or mouth can say ‘I do not want to see/hear/say 
this’. Holding hands or the whole body can indicate anxiety as the 
person literally holds themself. Self-preening can show a desire to be 
liked and can indicate desire of another.</p>
<h2>Beat gestures</h2>
<p>Beat gestures are just that, rhythmic beating of a finger, hand or 
arm. They can be as short as a single beat or as long as needed to make a
 particular point.</p>
<p>Beating and repetition plays to primitive feelings of basic 
patterning, and can vary in sense according to the context. A beat is a 
staccato strike that creates&nbsp;<a href="http://changingminds.org/techniques/language/modifying_meaning/emphasis.htm">emphasis</a>&nbsp;and
 grabs attention. A short and single beat can mark an important point in
 a conversation, whilst repeated beats can hammer home a critical 
concept.</p>
