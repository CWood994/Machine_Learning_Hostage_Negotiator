 <h2>Crisis negotiation</h2>
 <p>Crisis negotiation is a law enforcement technique used to communicate with people who are threatening violence, including barricaded subjects, stalkers, criminals attempting to escape after a botched robbery, and hostage-takers </p>

 <h2>First Responder</h2>
 <p>Crisis negotiation is often initiated by the first officer(s) on the scene</p>

 <h2>History</h2>
 <p>Modern hostage negotiation principles were established in 1972 when then-NYPD Detective Harvey Schlossberg, also a psychologist, recognized the need for trained personnel in crisis intervention.</p>

 <h2>Harvey Schlossberg</h2>
 <p>Schlossberg had worked on the David Berkowitz ("Son of Sam") case, and had instituted other psychological principles in police work, including psychological screening of police applicants and the use of hypnosis in suspect/witness interviews</p>

 <h2>First Hostage Negotiation Teams</h2>
 <p>The first Hostage Negotiation Teams (HNTs) were often created as elements of Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) Teams and merely created a diversion while SWAT deployed. In modern usage, while sometimes acting independently, hostage negotiation teams are often deployed in conjunction with SWAT</p>

 <h2>Behavioral Change Stairway Model</h2>
 <p>One specific model developed by the FBI is the Behavioral Change Stairway Model. Police negotiators that follow this model work through the following stages in order. 1. Active Listening. 2. Empathy. 3. Rapport. 4. Influence. 5. Behavioral Change. </p>

 <h2>What is Active Listening</h2>
 <p>Active listening is understanding the psychology of the perpetrator and let them know they are being listened to</p>

 <h2>What is Empathy</h2>
 <p>Empathy is understanding their issues and how they feel</p>

 <h2>What is Rapport</h2>
 <p>When they begin to see how the negotiator feels, they are building trust</p>

 <h2>What is Influence</h2>
 <p>Only once trust has been gained can solutions to their problem be recommended</p>

 <h2>What is Behavioral Change</h2>
 <p>Behavioral Change is how they act, and maybe surrender</p>
