<h1> What is hostage negotation? </h1>
	<p>
	Negotiation is one of the most delicate processes in a hostage recovery mission. 
	In some cases it is the only needed contact with the hostage takers, but in others 
	it is only used to stall while the tactical element takes over. "Priorities in a 
	hostage incident include preservation of life, apprehension of the HT, and recovering or 
	protecting property".(Fuselier,1981). Many times hostage taking is considered an act of 
	terrorism and is analyzed from the perspectives of foreign and domestic influences, the police 
	tactical response, the motivation for capitulation(capture), and the value of negotiation.(Miller,1980). 
	The job of hostage negotiators is to slowly dissolve the situation while saving lives. But sometimes negotiation 
	isn't enough and the use of brute forces is needed to save innocent life and may use lethal 
	force on the hostage takers.

<h1>What is the job of the hostage negotiator? What is my job? </h1>
	<p>
	It is the job of the police and hostage specialists to prevent escalation of the situation. 
	But the job of the first responding officer is very important. His job may be the most important 
	up to the job of the negotiator's because if he handles the situation poorly, the situation can go out of control.

<h1>What should I do first? What is ICER? What should I start with? How does hostage negotiation begin? </h1>
	<h2> Isolation </h2>
		<p>
		Isolate the area where the incident is taking place; creating a safe zone in case 
		something goes wrong and keeping civilians out of this area.
		</p>
	<h2> Contain </h2>
		<p>
		Limit the capabilities of the hostage taker and contain them within the inner perimeter of the safe zone. 
		Also keep them from seeing what the officers are doing if possible.	
		</p>
	<h2> Evaluate </h2>
		<p>
		Evaluate all the intelligence available, this initial information can come from the hostage taker or an intermediary (a hostage sent to talk to the police), or a witness of the events leading to the hostage situation.
		Try to figure out the amount of hostages, injuries, weapons, motive, etc. without escalating or provoking the situation.
		After this information is gathered the head officer can decide what the next step is.
		</p>
	<h2> Report </h2>
		<p>
		Report all available information gathered, including on the hostage takers and hostages, events, weapons, zones, routes and so on, informing other officers and the chain of command.
		It is very important that the on scene officer is aware of this process to contain the situation, prevent escalation of the hostage situation, and make the job easier for the negotiators so they can defuse the situation a quickly as possible. If all of these are done correctly the hostage negotiator can assess the situation and do his job smoothly. 
		</p>

<h1> What information is important? Finding information. What is some important information? </h1>
	<p>
	Negotiators will need all the information they cant get:
	The numbers and names of the hostage-takers.
	What they are demanding and what they really want.
	Their emotional state and how close they are to harming hostages.
	The numbers and general health of hostages.
	This information will come from the interviews with family, friends, and neighbors of the hostage taker and the hostage taker them self . the negotiators will find out much of this in the initial conversations with the hostage taker. more info will take time which sometimes leads to multiple days of negotiating. In many cases the hostage taker will only want to make demands and cut off all other communication and not reveal any more information. This is also useful for the police who will want numbers and locations of hostages so they can have a general idea if a raid is needed.
	</p>
	
<h1> How can I get close to the hostage taker? Getting close.</h1>
	<h2> Creating normality </h2>
		<p>
		Whilst there may be chaos and panic on all sides, the negotiator first seeks to create calm. They talk in a calm voice and do a great deal of listening. In particular, they seek to establish a sense of normality among the emotion, a space in which the hostage-takers can talk with the negotiator as reasonable people, much as you would talk with any normal person on the phone.
		The negotiator is always there and always ready to talk. They will listen to everything and will create an even keel on which reasonable negotiation can be conducted.
		</p>
	<h2> Creating Humanity </h2>
		<p>
		Within the normality, the negotiator listens uncritically to the hostage-taker, accepting them as they are and creating a sense of humanity. From that humanity, they then can extend to discussing the hostages, how they are bearing up and whether they are unwell.
		</p>
	<h2> Developing authority </h2>
		<p>
		The negotiator may also seek to position themselves as an authority figure. This can start by being authoritative on behalf of the hostage-taker, for example in getting them communications and food. This may later turn to being authoritative with the hostage-taker, which can be a tricky and dangerous activity as the hostage-taker wants to be in charge. Authoritative work may thus be done in particular circumstances. If the negotiators can establish this relationship, they may be able to direct the hostage-taker's actions more effectively.
		</p>
		
<h1> How do I progress in a hostage situation? What are some good first steps? </h1>
	<h2> Small steps </h2>
		<p>
		since trust is still being built small steps are required. It can range anywhere from giving them food to talking about football for a little while. The total amount of conversation may be adjusted according to the urgency. If the hostage-takers are requiring transport or other things that would lead to more problems, then it may be more prudent to insert delays, such as saying you are 'looking into it'
		</p>
	<h2> Managing Stress </h2>
		<p>
		Stress and tension will be ever present in these situations. This will complicate the situation even further unless dealt with properly. It is the negotiators job to make sure that the stress stays at a reasonable level and does not get out of control.
		</p>
	<h2> Exploring Situations </h2>
		<p>
		Eventually they can start discussing ways to end the situation. This needs to be done with extreme care as to not provoke the hostage taker to end communication. This could either immediate the release if the hostages or end poorly resulting in the injury or death of hostages. Sometimes the only thing the hostage taker wants is to have publicity and that is easily achievable.

<h1> Hostage rescue Team </h1>
	<p>
	The Hostage Rescue Team is made up of the best field agents in the FBI, so earning a spot is not easy. One must be in great physical and mental condition because a HRT operator must be prepared for anything. Agents mus also have at least 3 years of field experience and even then one may not even be invited. "FBI Special Agents who are invited to attend an HRT selection course undergo a physically rigorous and mentally demanding evaluation process."(fbijobs.gov). Individuals must be able to act professionally in a crisis situation an focus on the job at hand. The test involves a verity of physically demanding tests while have good judgment, thinking on your feet, and being a team player, despite being physically drained. Even if a candidate finishes the testing they may no make the team." Just surviving is not enough".
	</p>

<h1> Releasing the hostages </h1>
	<p>
	A hostage situation can come from anywhere at anytime. It's up to the men and women on hostage negotiation teams to save lives. Either through the use of advanced negotiation techniques or the swift and deadly force of The Hostage Rescue Team will bring innocent people home safe. Their techniques are built around the sole purpose of saving lives and it has been doing so for many years and will continue to do so in the future.
