 <h2>What it a Hostage Situation</h2>
 <p>A hostage Situation is a situation in which suspects take hostages to: a. protect themselves and/or b. attempt to force some action on the part of the police.</p>

 <h2>GOALS</h2>
 <p>To establish clear, safe, practical, and effective policy and procedures, and to insure continuity and accountability before during and after a hostage situation. To prepare officers to handle hostage situations as safely as possible for all concerned persons. To teach specific operational procedures and negotiation skills for hostage situations.
</p>

 <h2>PHILOSOPHY</h2>
 <p>A. To save the lives of: 1. hostages 2. uninvolved citizens 3. officers 4. hostage takers. B. To control and manage situations to minimize the impact on the rest of the community. C. To prevent the escape of the hostage taker(s). D. To seek resolution without use of force whenever possible. E. To properly conclude hostage situations. F. To gain knowledge from each situation.</p>

 <h2>Should I stall, waste time</h2>
 <p>Time usually costs nothing but the anxieties of action-oriented officers. No movement or action should be forced in a situation which can be more safely handled by using time as an advantage.</p>

 <h2>The Stockholm Theory</h2>
 <p>The longer hostage takers are in contact with hostages, the less likely they are to harm the hostages. Personal interaction under stress creates quick emotional involvement among people. Hostages may be drawn toward hostage takers.</p>

 <h2>DECISION MAKERS SHALL NOT DIRECTLY NEGOTIATE</h2>
 <p>DECISION MAKERS SHALL NOT DIRECTLY NEGOTIATE Decisions on proposals and counter offers shall be made through the negotiation team. This applies regardless of the means of communications between suspects and the negotiation team.</p>

 <h2>Standby Emergency Medical Personnel</h2>
 <p>The Fire Department and an ambulance should be requested immediately. Remember, the possibility of a situation deteriorating is highest before stabilization. Their response should be to a safe location immediately outside the danger zone. This location can be changed after the situation is stabilized.</p>

 <h2>INITIAL AUTHORITY</h2>
 <p>Initial authority rests with the first officer on the scene, regardless of assignment. If
several officers arrive at the same time, the senior officer shall assume initial authority.</p>

 <h2>STABILIZING HOSTAGE SITUATIONS--LOGISTICAL CONCERNS</h2>
 <p>Once containment is achieved and sufficient personnel have arrived, the situation can be stabilized and preparations made to begin the negotiation process. The following logistical concerns are:Communications among Police Personnel. General Personnel Considerations. General Personnel Deployment. Special Teams Deployment. Specialized Personnel Deployment. Specialized Equipment Deployment. Allied Agencies Personnel/Equipment Deployment</p>

 <h2>Communications among Police Personnel</h2>
 <p>All personnel shall be in radio communication. One (1) radio channel and one (1) dispatcher shall be dedicated to the operation.</p>

 <h2>General Personnel Considerations</h2>
 <p>While it is necessary to have sufficient personnel on hand to deal with the situation, it is critical that the number be limited to those necessary. All personnel must be under supervision and have definite assignments. The identity, location, and movement of all personnel must be strictly monitored by the IC and the dispatcher to enable the IC to deploy personnel as needed.</p>

 <h2>General Personnel Deployment</h2>
 <p>The Outer Perimeter Group - usually officers and Community service officers. They: establish, and maintain safe, a perimeter outside and away from the danger zone. prevent unauthorized personnel and citizens, who may endanger themselves or cause additional problems, from entering the area. detain and identify all persons leaving the area. may refer some persons to the officer(s) gathering intelligence for debriefing or interviews.</p>

 <h2>Special Teams Deployment</h2>
 <p>Special Teams may be either required or simply available, i.e. Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Team.</p>

 <h2>Specialized Personnel Deployment</h2>
 <p>Specialized Personnel consist of: Detectives. Interpreters. Crime Scene Investigators (CSI). Police Information Officer</p>

 <h2>Specialized Equipment Deployment</h2>
 <p>pecialized Equipment can consist of CP Motorhome. Patrol Wagons. 4-wheel drive vehicles. Negotiations Teams vehicles</p>

 <h2>Allied Agencies Personnel/Equipment Deployment</h2>
 <p>Allied Agencies Personnel/Equipment consists of Deputy District Attorneys. Probation Officers or Parole Agents. Helicopters. Fire Department lighting, generator, or power tools</p>

 <h2>THE INCIDENT COMMAND POST</h2>
 <p>The Incident CP is a strategic position, not to be confused with the CP Motorhome. The Incident CP shall be established as soon as possible, generally as soon as containment is achieved. The location should be: safe, practical, out of sight of the hostage taker, Incident CP Personnel, The IC. The Operations Officer: The Communications Officer, The CP Recorder, The Logistics Officer (at the Area facility) </p>
